				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Can it be a year since the last list? Here goes with my favorite 20 releases of 2017. Your tastes are not mine, you will disagree, but maybe there is something here that you might not have discovered, something of beauty that might bring you joy. At one point I thought this might be a thin year; when I got down to making the list I realized there was no filler at the bottom. Exact placement is fuzzy – there are lots of apples and oranges being compared here. Feel free to move any of these up or down a few places in your head.</p>
<p><a href="https://12kmusic.bandcamp.com/album/somi"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5412" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/top-20-of-2017-david-smith/Somi-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="200" srcset="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/top-20-of-2017-david-smith/Somi-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/top-20-of-2017-david-smith/Somi-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/top-20-of-2017-david-smith/Somi.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" /></a><strong>#1. Taylor Deupree – Somi</strong></p>
<p>Deupree’s <em>Faint</em> from a few years ago is still one of my regular listens and pleasures, and I wonder with hindsight if I should have placed it at number one that year. He gave me another chance with the magnificent, meditative <em>Somi</em>. Loops of single notes from acoustic instruments played at varying intervals are layered and treated to create a fascinating slow dance of beauty and rest. And the deluxe edition packaging was as gorgeous as the music. (<a href="https://12kmusic.bandcamp.com/album/somi">Listen</a>)</p>

<p><strong>#2. Daniel Herskedal – The Roc</strong></p>
<p>Norwegian tubaist Herskedal’s new album adds an Arabic influence to his tuba-based jazz-folk explorations. The result is a unique, at times magical set of tunes high in atmosphere and richly colored. Several parts of this album stayed in my head all year. (<a href="https://danielherskedal.bandcamp.com/album/the-roc">Listen</a>)</p>

<p><strong>#3. Pausal – Avifaunal</strong></p>
<p>Pausal’s warm and finely textured drones have been growing on me the last few years. This year’s release took things up a notch, with a sweeping grandeur and narrative flow that make each minute count. An album to get lost in. (<a href="https://dronarivm.bandcamp.com/album/avifaunal">Listen</a>)</p>

<p><a href="http://anzicstore.com/album/happy-song"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5417" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/top-20-of-2017-david-smith/Anat-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a></p>
<p><strong>#4. Anat Cohen Tentet – Happy Song</strong></p>
<p>The title and bright yellow cover are apt. New York-based Israeli clarinetist Cohen and her ensemble deliver a vibrantly grooving set of jazz romps that shift in character as the album progresses while maintaining an infectious sense of joy. (<a href="http://anzicstore.com/album/happy-song">Listen</a>)</p>

<p><strong>#5. Tinariwen – Elwan</strong></p>
<p>The Saharan blues return with the latest from the great Tuareg band, and it’s one of their finest. The sinuous, swaying rhythms undergird starkly poetic laments at the loss of social and environmental fabric.

<p><strong>#6. Seldom Sene Recorder Consort – Goldberg Variations</strong></p>
<p>As the title gives away, this is the Goldberg Variations played on recorders by a Dutch recorder consort. In addition to the virtuoso playing, the different sonorities of the wind instruments made the Goldbergs sparkle for me in a gentle and delightful new way. (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJQAgA44gCM">Listen</a>) (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdpwCWBuXpI">Listen</a>)</p>

<p><strong>#7. Otto A. Totland – The Lost</strong></p>
<p>Very similar in spirit to its predecessor, <em>Pinô</em>, this second album of piano solos again showcases Norwegian pianist Otto Totland’s ability to conjure a gentle, plaintive warmth through small melodies and soft sounds. (<a href="https://ottoatotland.bandcamp.com/">Listen</a>)</p>

<p><strong>#8. Chihei Hatakeyama &amp; Federico Durand – Sora</strong></p>
<p>Combining Hatakeyama’s characteristic gossamer tonal washes and Durand’s delightfully pattering small sounds is a recipe for enormous prettiness, and that is just what we get on this deeply calming album. (<a href="https://chiheihatakeyama.bandcamp.com/album/sora">Listen</a>)</p>

<p><strong>#9. The Green Kingdom – The North Wind and the Sun</strong></p>
<p>The Green Kingdom has issued a long series of recordings offering an attractive world of delicate small sounds and textures. This release feels like something fresh as it bursts forth into uplifting melody thanks to the foregrounded guitar work. (<a href="https://thegreenkingdom.bandcamp.com/album/the-north-wind-and-the-sun">Listen/Watch</a>)</p>

<p><strong>#10. Emile Parisien, Vincent Peirani, Andreas Schaerer &amp; Michael Wollny – Out of Land</strong></p>
<p>An unusual but top-notch European jazz combo consisting of sax, accordion, piano, and vocalizations/beatboxing. The live recordings prickle with energy and abound in creativity, making for an exciting listen. (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAKio4qfeqM">Watch</a>)</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://homeassemblymusic.bandcamp.com/album/weve-all-been-swimming"><img class="alignleft wp-image-5421 size-thumbnail" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/top-20-of-2017-david-smith/Fieldhead-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/top-20-of-2017-david-smith/Fieldhead-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/top-20-of-2017-david-smith/Fieldhead-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/top-20-of-2017-david-smith/Fieldhead-768x768.jpg 768w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/top-20-of-2017-david-smith/Fieldhead-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/top-20-of-2017-david-smith/Fieldhead.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a></strong></p>
<p><strong>#11. Fieldhead – We’ve All Been Swimming</strong></p>
<p>Fieldhead’s latest is by far my favorite by the artist so far. It plays with odd rhythmic combinations, layering looping synth melodies over divergent rhythms. The result is a kind of mellow fascination, and great fun. (<a href="https://homeassemblymusic.bandcamp.com/album/weve-all-been-swimming">Listen</a>)</p>

<p><strong>#12. Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark – The Punishment of Luxury</strong></p>
<p>Not much pop makes my lists, but I loved OMD as a teen, and this new release sounds as if it could have been the immediate follow up to 1983’s <em>Dazzle Ships</em>. It nails what made their original Kraftwerk-with-soul sound special, and that made me grin. (<a href="https://officialomd.bandcamp.com/releases">Listen</a>)</p>

<p><strong>#13. Rudresh Mahanthappa/Indo-Pak Coalition – Agrima </strong></p>

<p><strong>#14. Helge Lien Trio – Guzuguzu</strong></p>
<p>With track titles drawn from Japanese onomatopoeia, Helge Lien’s latest piano trio album is made up of moody evocations of atmosphere and movement, often skirting around song structures.

<p><strong>#15. Porya Hatami – Monads</strong></p>
<p>When I posted my review of this to Facebook none of my friends hit “like,” and it is admittedly a pretty abstract set of experiments with sound rather than a collection of tunes. But they are fascinating experiments, glimpses into the push-and-pull of forces that make the world a place with sound.

<p><strong>#16. Yazz Ahmed – La Saboteuse</strong></p>
<p>Ahmed is a British-Bahraini trumpeter who here successfully melds Arabic motifs, electronic treatments, and jazz trumpet in a set of beguiling tunes. (<a href="https://yazzahmed.bandcamp.com/album/la-saboteuse-2">Listen</a>)</p>

<p><strong>#17. Alea Saxophone Quartet – Arvo Pärt: Anima</strong></p>
<p>If the idea of Pärt played on saxophones conjures up a mental collision of ethereal voices and ill-chosen skronking, think again. The pure tones and harmonies of the sax quartet evocatively capture the spirit of Pärt’s austere choral pieces. (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjbB3NPiL1QTbsipfDysz0M1KRCfMzeLD">Listen</a>)</p>

<p><strong>#18. Taylor Deupree &amp; Marcus Fischer – Lowlands</strong></p>
<p>Building on previous outings as a duo, Deupree and Fischer again show a mastery of the microscopic world of small resonances, adding another delightful release to their growing oeuvre. (<a href="https://12kmusic.bandcamp.com/album/lowlands">Listen</a>)</p>

<p><strong>#19. Brot &amp; Sterne – Tales of Herbst</strong></p>
<p>This was not quite like anything else I listened to, which is perhaps not surprising in the case of a hurdy-gurdy/hang drum/trumpet jazz trio. The improvised instrumentals set warmly tuneful passages amid unique and atmospheric textures. (<a href="https://brotundsterne.bandcamp.com/releases">Listen</a>)</p>

<p><strong>#20. Billow Observatory – II: Plains/Patterns </strong></p>
<p>More active than their debut release, this collection of ambient pieces pulses and shimmers airily. Enjoyable throughout. (<a href="https://billowobservatory.bandcamp.com/album/ii-plains-patterns">Listen</a>)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>The next 10&#8230;</strong></p>
<p>And here are ten more that I had a really hard time cutting to get the list down to 20. Some of these jumped in and out of my list several times, and might have made it if I had finalized the list tomorrow. Alphabetically:</p>
<p>Wil Bolton – Night Paths (Ambient)</p>
<p>Bruce Cockburn – Bone on Bone (Folk)</p>
<p>Marcus Fischer – Loss (Ambient)</p>
<p>From the Mouth of the Sun – Hymn Binding (Modern Classical)</p>
<p>Ian Hawgood &amp; Wil Bolton – Transparencies (Ambient)</p>
<p>Hudson – Hudson (Jazz)</p>
<p>Rafael Anton Irisarri – The Shameless Years (Ambient)</p>
<p>Benedikt Jahnel Trio – The Invariant (Piano jazz)</p>
<p>Darren McClure – Nature Mirror (Ambient)</p>
<p>Phronesis, Julian Argüelles, &amp; Frankfurt Radio Big Band – The Behemoth (Jazz)</p>
<p>As ever, if any of the artists happen by, thank you for another year of inspiring music.</p>

<p>Saw a lot of live music this year, with well over 100 different bands represented.  These were the best of the bunch:<span id="more-5319"></span></p>
<p class="UFICommentBody _1n4g"><strong>15. <span data-ft="{&quot;tn&quot;:&quot;K&quot;}"><span class="UFICommentBody _1n4g">Wand: November 5, 2015 &#8211; 7th Street Entry</span></span></strong></p>
<p class="UFICommentBody _1n4g">Wand showed up in the Entry and blew the doors off the place.  A technically very talented band, Wand is able to transfer their skills from the studio to the stage better than a vast majority of similar bands.</p>
<p><strong>14. <span data-ft="{&quot;tn&quot;:&quot;K&quot;}"><span class="UFICommentBody _1n4g">Miguel: August 15, 2015 &#8211; State Theater</span></span></strong></p>
<p>Miguel is an incredible performer with magnificent stage presence.  His only real negative is a tendency towards unnecessary, and eye rolling, preachiness.  The show was moved from First Avenue due to a ceiling collapse, otherwise it would likely rank higher.</p>
<p><strong>13. <span data-ft="{&quot;tn&quot;:&quot;K&quot;}"><span class="UFICommentBody _1n4g">White Lung: June 11, 2015 &#8211; 7th Street Entry</span></span></strong></p>
<p>There are few things in this world as invigorating as a truly blazing punk show, and White Lung qualifies.  Mish Way is a banshee of a frontwoman, and the band absolutely crushed it.</p>
<p><strong>12. <span data-ft="{&quot;tn&quot;:&quot;K&quot;}"><span class="UFICommentBody _1n4g">Hot Chip: May 30, 2015 &#8211; First Avenue</span></span></strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s difficult to comprehend the vast number of great songs in Hot Chip&#8217;s catalog until you hear them all at the same time.  It makes for a seriously fun show, especially when capped off by a Springsteen cover.</p>
<p><strong>11. <span data-ft="{&quot;tn&quot;:&quot;K&quot;}"><span class="UFICommentBody _1n4g">TV on the Radio: July 30, 2015 &#8211; First Avenue</span></span></strong></p>
<p>TV on the Radio doesn&#8217;t mess around with gimmicks.  They just take the stage and rock the audience&#8217;s socks off.  In this instance, however, they did close with one of the best of the many &#8216;Purple Rain&#8217; covers played in the Mainroom.</p>
<p><strong>10. <span data-ft="{&quot;tn&quot;:&quot;K&quot;}"><span class="UFICommentBody _1n4g">Vince Staples: December 13, 2015 &#8211; Fine Line</span></span></strong></p>
<p>On <em>Summertime &#8217;06</em>, Vince Staples comes across as a survivor.  He&#8217;s a guy who can grow up surrounded by pain, but make it through.  In concert it becomes clear that in addition to this, he&#8217;s a truly funny guy, and the combination of humor and pain makes for a fascinating show.</p>
<p><strong>9. <span data-ft="{&quot;tn&quot;:&quot;K&quot;}"><span class="UFICommentBody _1n4g">Algiers: June 16, 2015 &#8211; Triple Rock</span></span></strong></p>
<p>Algiers played this show before about 30 people, but you wouldn&#8217;t have known it from their performance.  The energy level was off the charts (especially from bassist Ryan Mahan), which added to the already existing urgency in the band&#8217;s gospel, post punk.</p>
<p><strong>8. <span data-ft="{&quot;tn&quot;:&quot;K&quot;}"><span class="UFICommentBody _1n4g">Titus Andronicus: October 9, 2015 &#8211; Triple Rock</span></span></strong></p>
<p>One of the best rock bands going right now, Titus Andronicus always brings it live, and the TMLT tour was no exception (even if they were distracted by the Mets in the World Series).  A great rock show with a crowd that couldn&#8217;t get enough.</p>
<p><strong>7. <span data-ft="{&quot;tn&quot;:&quot;K&quot;}"><span class="UFICommentBody _1n4g">The Replacements: May 2, 2015 &#8211; The Rave</span></span></strong></p>
<p>A ballroom in Milwaukee is no Midway Stadium filled to bursting, but any opportunity to see Paul Westerberg, Tommy Stinson, and crew play those songs is a gift.  Sadly we might have seen the last of The Mats.</p>
<p><strong>6. <span data-ft="{&quot;tn&quot;:&quot;K&quot;}"><span class="UFICommentBody _1n4g">Big Star&#8217;s Third: September 30, 2015 &#8211; First Avenue</span></span></strong></p>
<p>A performance of Big Star&#8217;s <em>Third</em>, plus the &#8216;hits,&#8217; featuring Big Star&#8217;s Jody Stephenson, The dB&#8217;s Chris Stamey, The Posies&#8217; Ken Stringfellow, R.E.M.&#8217;s Mike Mills, and many, many others. It was an absolute joy to hear this songs live.</p>
<p><strong>5. <span data-ft="{&quot;tn&quot;:&quot;K&quot;}"><span class="UFICommentBody _1n4g">Run the Jewels: October 23, 2015 &#8211; First Avenue</span></span></strong></p>
<p>RtJ has done basically the same show for the last two years, but it doesn&#8217;t matter.  The energy and comradery between Killer Mike and El-P is overwhelming and infectious.  Add that to the fire that is RtJ songs, and it&#8217;s a great night no matter how many times you&#8217;ve seen it.</p>
<p><strong>4. <span data-ft="{&quot;tn&quot;:&quot;K&quot;}"><span class="UFICommentBody _1n4g">Stevie Wonder: March 29, 2015 &#8211; Target Center</span></span></strong></p>
<p>Stevie Wonder brought more than 40 musicians to the stage, including India.Arie, and performed <em>Songs in the Key of Life</em> in its entirety before finishing with some hits, including a show stopping performance of &#8220;Superstition&#8221;.  If it hadn&#8217;t been in an arena this would be #1 by far.</p>
<p><strong>3. <span data-ft="{&quot;tn&quot;:&quot;K&quot;}"><span class="UFICommentBody _1n4g">Kraftwerk: October 7, 2015 &#8211; Northrop</span></span></strong></p>
<p>Four old German guys in funny spandex outfits standing in front of early 80s 3D technology shouldn&#8217;t be great, but it absolutely is.  Then they brought out the robots.  Kraftwerk are true legends and they do what they do very, very well.</p>
<p><strong><span data-ft="{&quot;tn&quot;:&quot;K&quot;}"><span class="UFICommentBody _1n4g">2. Sleater-Kinney: February 14, 2015 &#8211; First Avenue</span></span></strong></p>
<p>They haven&#8217;t lost anything.  Carrie Brownstein still wails on the guitar while doing high kicks, Janet Weiss still crushes the drums, and Corin Tucker&#8217;s voice might be better than ever (she was especially devastating on &#8220;Gimme Love&#8221;).  The crowd was in ecstasy throughout.</p>
<p><strong><span data-ft="{&quot;tn&quot;:&quot;K&quot;}"><span class="UFICommentBody _1n4g">1. Father John Misty: April 4, 2015 &#8211; First Avenue</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span data-ft="{&quot;tn&quot;:&quot;K&quot;}"><span class="UFICommentBody _1n4g">The hype surrounding a Father John Misty live show is immense.  It would be very easy for Josh Tillman to dial it back a bit and still leave the crowd happy, but he refuses to do so.  He puts absolutely everything he has into every note, every gesture, and every word with the crowd.  It&#8217;s a remarkable thing to witness, and if you haven&#8217;t yet done so, you must.<br />

<p><strong>24. Speedy Ortiz – <em>Foil Deer</em></strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-april-21-2015/Speedy-Ortiz-Foil-Deer.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-4976"><img class="alignleft wp-image-4976 size-thumbnail" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-april-21-2015/Speedy-Ortiz-Foil-Deer-150x150.jpg" alt="Speedy Ortiz - Foil Deer" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-april-21-2015/Speedy-Ortiz-Foil-Deer-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-april-21-2015/Speedy-Ortiz-Foil-Deer.jpg 280w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a>Speedy Ortiz’s previous releases were enjoyable, but often lacked the hooks to take the band to the next level.  <em>Foil Deer</em> does not have that deficiency. It has hooks for days.  Sadie Dupuis’ voice and the album’s guitar tones bring to mind 90s artists like Liz Phair and Veruca Salt, but <em>Foil Deer</em> is noise pop for this generation.</p>

<p><strong>23. Chvrches – <em>Every Open Eye</em></strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-25-of-2015-craig-mcmanus/Chvrches-Every-Open-Eye.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-5266"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5266" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-25-of-2015-craig-mcmanus/Chvrches-Every-Open-Eye-150x150.jpg" alt="Chvrches - Every Open Eye" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-25-of-2015-craig-mcmanus/Chvrches-Every-Open-Eye-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-25-of-2015-craig-mcmanus/Chvrches-Every-Open-Eye.jpg 280w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a>The best word to describe <em>Every Open Eye </em>is &#8216;pristine.&#8217;  The album sees Chvrches bring their brand of indie, synth pop ever closer to the pop mainstream.  In fact, there is no doubt that a little Top 40 radio airplay would see the band deservedly break through that barrier.</p>

<p><strong>22. Young Thug – <em>Barter 6</em></strong></p>

It’s hooky, full of intricate flows and odd bars, and of course features Thugga’s distinctive voice.  Where this tape stands out among Thug&#8217;s output of the last couple years, however, is the production.  The beats here are almost languid and Thug’s flow often slows down to ride in the pocket.</p>

<p><strong>21. Lower Dens – <em>Escape From Evil</em></strong></p>

Even with the new direction, however, the band’s music rises and falls with Jana Hunter’s strong alto vocals, and <em>Escape From Evil</em> has far more rise than fall.</p>

<p><strong>20. Miguel – <em>Wildheart</em></strong></p>

<p><strong>18. Unknown Mortal Orchestra – <em>Multi Love</em></strong></p>

<p><strong>17. Jamie xx – <em>In Colour</em></strong></p>

<p><strong>16. Screaming Females – <em>Rose Mountain</em></strong></p>

<p><strong>15. Metz – <em>II</em></strong></p>

<p><strong>13. Algiers – <em>s/t</em></strong></p>

<p><strong>3. Titus Andronicus – <em>The Most Lamentable Tragedy</em></strong></p>

<p><em>The Most Lamentable Tragedy</em> may not be Titus Andronicus’ best album, but due to its in-depth focus on mental illness it is easily their most important.  The lyrics, dark and beautiful, despairing and hopeful, are what frontman Patrick Stickles has been building towards for his entire career, and are devastatingly important.</p>

<p><em>The Most Lamentable Tragedy</em> is a double, concept album focusing on a protagonist dealing (like Titus Andronicus frontman Patrick Stickles) with mental illness.  Stickles has been actively working on <em>TMLT</em> for about the last 4 years, but in many ways the album has been foreshadowed (both thematically and musically) for the band&#8217;s entire existence.</p>
<p>Lyrically, <em>TMLT</em> is dark and beautiful, despairing and hopeful, and will move many to tears.  Divided into 5 parts, the lyrics follow the unnamed person through all the ups and downs of manic depression: Breakdown, treatment, prescriptions, the highs and lows that still affect everything you do, and how to connect with your loved ones who, despite their best efforts, can&#8217;t begin to understand what you&#8217;re going through.  Mostly, though, the album is about the internal war between a person and himself, and this war does not have a happy ending.<span id="more-5173"></span></p>
<p>Musically, however, <em>TMLT</em> is everything expected from Titus Andronicus and then some.  There are bar room rockers highlighted by. &#8220;Mr. E. Mann&#8221; and &#8220;Fatal Flaw,&#8221; and there are punk bangers like &#8220;Dimed Out&#8221; and &#8220;(S)He Said, (S)He Said.&#8221;  Most interestingly, though, the sound throughout <em>TMLT</em> has been fleshed out with strings arranged by the fantastic Owen Pallett.  This addition to the band&#8217;s sound allows them to create the closest thing to a pop, love song they&#8217;ve ever released in &#8220;Come On, <span class="a-declarative" data-action="a-popover" data-a-popover="{&quot;closeButton&quot;:&quot;false&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;trackTitlePopover_B0115S3SY0&quot;,&quot;position&quot;:&quot;triggerTop&quot;}">Siobhán.&#8221;  Finally, there are the usual sprawling tracks like &#8220;More Perfect Union&#8221; that combine all these threads and even throw in some Irish pub song for good measure.</span></p>
<p>On the whole,<em> TMLT</em> may not be Titus Andronicus&#8217; best album (that title likely still belongs to <em>The Monitor</em>), but it is easily their most important and will be the album for which they are remembered.  Put quite simply, if this is what Titus Andronicus has been building towards, it&#8217;s a more than worthy capstone to their career no matter where they go from here.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/the-new-music-friday-3-for-july-31-2015/Migos-Yung-Rich-Nation.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5175" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/the-new-music-friday-3-for-july-31-2015/Migos-Yung-Rich-Nation.jpg" alt="Migos - Yung Rich Nation" width="280" height="280" srcset="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/the-new-music-friday-3-for-july-31-2015/Migos-Yung-Rich-Nation.jpg 280w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/the-new-music-friday-3-for-july-31-2015/Migos-Yung-Rich-Nation-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 280px) 100vw, 280px" /></a><strong>Migos &#8211; <em>Yung Rich Nation</em></strong></p>
<p>In the past, labels have tried to rein in mixtape artists in order to create records with something for everyone regardless of whether the artist is capable of changing styles.  On their debut LP, however, Migos sound exactly like they have on the tapes that got them signed in the first place, and this is a very good thing.  <em>Yung Rich Nation</em> finds the trio still trading both verses and bars, still coming up with one or two word hooks and repeating them until you can&#8217;t get them out of your head (people are going to love yelling &#8220;bachelor&#8221; and &#8220;spray the champagne&#8221;), and still going in hard as hell.  The only real difference between <em>YRN</em> and the earlier mixtapes is the production.  It feels sparser here and does a great job adding to the group&#8217;s flow without overwhelming it.  The combination is excellent and makes for a really fun listen.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/the-new-music-friday-3-for-july-31-2015/Gunplay-Living-Legend.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5174" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/the-new-music-friday-3-for-july-31-2015/Gunplay-Living-Legend.jpg" alt="Gunplay - Living Legend" width="280" height="280" srcset="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/the-new-music-friday-3-for-july-31-2015/Gunplay-Living-Legend.jpg 280w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/the-new-music-friday-3-for-july-31-2015/Gunplay-Living-Legend-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 280px) 100vw, 280px" /></a><strong>Gunplay &#8211; <em>Living Legend</em></strong></p>
<p>A part of Rick Ross&#8217; Maybach Music Group, Gunplay has been a go-to guy for unhinged, violent features for the better part of a decade, but despite repeated false starts he has never released a solo LP.  In fact, it got to a point where the general consensus was that any LP that did finally come out would be less than stellar, so the expectations for <em>Living Legend</em> were incredibly low.  Happily, the expectations for its follow up will be much higher.  Lyrically <em>Living Legend</em> is hardcore gangsta rap through-and-through, and Gunplay&#8217;s flow is redlined to such an extent you get the feeling his life depends on getting these verses out as fast and loud as possible.  That flow is backed by a bass heavy production (other than the G-Funk of &#8220;Wuzhanindoe feat. YG&#8221;) that adds to the album&#8217;s dark, street feel.  <em>Living Legend</em> isn&#8217;t likely to win any awards, but hip hop fans will be very happy with it.</p>

<p>The best known Syrian dabke wedding singer, now based in Turkey due to the Syrian civil war, is back with his second studio recording following 147,692 (number approximate) tape releases in his native country.  Souleyman, who uses electronics and his soulful voice to craft fun, incredibly danceable tunes, again worked with Four Tet&#8217;s Kieran Hebden on <em>Bahdeni Nami</em> and the album does not disappoint.  Souleyman&#8217;s lyrics are, of course, in Arabic, so very few native English speakers will be able to understand them, but the sound of his voice blends so well the music&#8217;s high pitched keyboard sounds that their meaning is really irrelevant.  All that matters is the music irresistibly makes hips shake and heads bob.<span id="more-5168"></span></p>

<p>Thomas Arsenault, a/k/a Mas Ysa, is a Canadian electronic musician who uses keyboards and 80&#8217;s drum machine beats to create a stripped back new wave music updated for 2015.  Alternately up tempo and vaguely droning, <em>Seraph</em>, his debut full length, doesn&#8217;t overwhelm the listener with sound, but instead plays with space and mellowness in a manner not common in the genre.  This brings a darkness into the music that separates <em>Seraph</em> from its occasionally punch line inducing forebearers, and creates a fascinating and recommended listen.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/the-new-music-friday-3-for-july-24-2015/Strange-Wilds-Subjective-Concepts.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5171" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/the-new-music-friday-3-for-july-24-2015/Strange-Wilds-Subjective-Concepts.jpg" alt="Strange Wilds - Subjective Concepts" width="280" height="280" srcset="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/the-new-music-friday-3-for-july-24-2015/Strange-Wilds-Subjective-Concepts.jpg 280w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/the-new-music-friday-3-for-july-24-2015/Strange-Wilds-Subjective-Concepts-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 280px) 100vw, 280px" /></a><strong>Strange Wilds &#8211; <em>Subjective Concepts</em></strong></p>
<p>Sub Pop made its name with bands from the Pacific Northwest playing aggressive rock, but over the years they&#8217;ve grown beyond that sound to include everything from Shabazz Palaces&#8217; experimental hip hop to Luluc&#8217;s indie folk.  Strange Wilds is a return to Sub Pop&#8217;s roots.  A power trio from Olympia, Washington, Strange Wilds&#8217; debut LP <em>Subjective Concepts</em> would fit in perfectly with the label&#8217;s 90&#8217;s roster (to the point where the guitar on &#8220;Lost and Found&#8221; sounds lifted directly from &#8220;Smells Like Teen Spirit&#8221;).  Similar in feel to Metz, and made up of roaring guitars and vocals backed by heavy drums and bass, <em>Subjective Concepts</em> is a record made for headbanging and crowdsurfing and is highly recommended for all those lamenting the death of rock.</p>

<p>Conor Oberst is a busy man.  He has his solo work, he&#8217;s the frontman of Bright Eyes, a member of Monsters of Folk, a founder of Saddle Creek Records, etc. etc. etc.  His hardest hitting job, though, is as the front man of punk band Desaparecidos.  The band was originally formed in 2001 and released <em>Read Music/Speak Spanish</em> the following year before disbanding.  In 2010, the band reformed and started releasing occasional singles, which have been compiled (and added to) on <em>Payola</em>, an album of 14 2-3 minute bursts of pure punk rock.  A listener who goes into <em>Payola</em> expecting the gentle sounds and confessional lyrics of most Oberst projects will be taken aback by the distorted guitars and political ideas, but Oberst isn&#8217;t posing here.  He commits fully to the punk ethos and creates a record with depth, breadth, and a whole lot of fun.<span id="more-5145"></span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-june-23-2015/Bully-Feels-Like.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5146" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-june-23-2015/Bully-Feels-Like.jpg" alt="Bully - Feels Like" width="280" height="280" srcset="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-june-23-2015/Bully-Feels-Like.jpg 280w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-june-23-2015/Bully-Feels-Like-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 280px) 100vw, 280px" /></a><strong>Bully &#8211; <em>Feels Like</em></strong></p>
<p>Bully stems from songs written by frontwoman Alicia Bognanno after an internship at Steve Albini&#8217;s Electrical Audio in Chicago.  Once she returned to Nashville, Bognanno put together a band to bring her songs to life, and the result is a noise pop band heavily influenced by acts of the early 90s.  The songs on Bully&#8217;s debut, <em>Feels Like</em>, are almost uniformly fast paced, feature a loud/quiet/loud formula, and are highlighted by fuzzed out guitars and Bognanno&#8217;s singing alternating between breathy and shouted.  This is an album for speeding down the highway with the windows down and the stereo turned to 11.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-june-23-2015/Wolf-Alice-My-Love-is-Cool.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5148" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-june-23-2015/Wolf-Alice-My-Love-is-Cool.jpg" alt="Wolf Alice - My Love is Cool" width="280" height="280" srcset="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-june-23-2015/Wolf-Alice-My-Love-is-Cool.jpg 280w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-june-23-2015/Wolf-Alice-My-Love-is-Cool-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 280px) 100vw, 280px" /></a><strong>Wolf Alice &#8211; <em>My Love is Cool</em></strong></p>
<p>Following the release of two EPs, London quartet Wolf Alice have spent the last couple years building anticipation for their major label debut.  With the release of <em>My Love is Cool</em>, that debut is finally here, and presents another band heavily influenced by early 90s artists.  Most interestingly, however, the album announces that Wolf Alice is more than a one trick pony.  Lead singles &#8220;Moaning Lisa Smile&#8221; and &#8220;Giant Peach&#8221; ably demonstrated Wolf Alice&#8217;s power and noisier side (very similar to artists like Garbage), but the album actually starts with &#8220;Turn to Dust&#8221; and &#8220;Bros&#8221;, which are almost gentle while maintaining the quality of their predecessors.  <em>My Love is Cool</em> is a well rounded, excellent album.</p>

<p><strong>Fucked Up &#8211; <em>Year of the Hare</em></strong></p>
<p>Toronto hardcore punks Fucked Up have a tradition of an annual EP release based on the Chinese Zodiac.  Interestingly, despite being a hardcore band, each of the Zodiac EPs sees the band try out long, sprawling tracks and <em>Year of the Hare</em> is no exception.  Stretching to a mammoth 21 and a half minutes, the title track opens with nearly 7 minutes of guitar picking/strums and gentle piano before the band and Pink Eyes&#8217; vocals enter in.  Even when they do, it is not a hardcore thrash (although Pink Eyes still sounds as guttural as ever until he drops out in favor of guest vocalist Isla Craig), but a fairly traditional rock song until about the 17 minute mark when the guitars ramp up, cut out completely at about 18:30, roar back with a vengeance, and then end the track the way it began.  It&#8217;s a fascinating listen, as is b-side &#8220;California Cold&#8221;, which features&#8230;flutes?  And drones?  This band is the best.<span id="more-5139"></span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-june-16-2015/Heartless-Bastards-Restless-Ones.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5141" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-june-16-2015/Heartless-Bastards-Restless-Ones.jpg" alt="Heartless Bastards - Restless Ones" width="280" height="280" srcset="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-june-16-2015/Heartless-Bastards-Restless-Ones.jpg 280w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-june-16-2015/Heartless-Bastards-Restless-Ones-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 280px) 100vw, 280px" /></a><strong>Heartless Bastards &#8211; <em>Restless Ones</em></strong></p>
<p>Roots rockers Heartless Bastards&#8217; fifth (!) studio release, <em>Restless Ones</em> continues Erika Wennerstrom&#8217;s exploration of 21st century blues rock.  Anchored by Wennerstrom&#8217;s distinctive, nearly tenor howl, a whole lot of guitar, and highlighted by lead single &#8220;Gates of Dawn&#8221; and &#8220;Into the Light&#8221;, <em>Restless Ones</em>, like basically all Heartless Bastards&#8217; albums before it, is just a solid album from beginning to end.  It&#8217;s really a remarkable thing for a band to continually find tweaks to keep its sound fresh without resorting to a complete reboot, but Heartless Bastards (and Wennerstrom in particular) have managed to find that formula.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-june-16-2015/Jaakko-Eino-Kalevi-Jaakko-Eino-Kalevi.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5142" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-june-16-2015/Jaakko-Eino-Kalevi-Jaakko-Eino-Kalevi.jpg" alt="Jaakko Eino Kalevi - Jaakko Eino Kalevi" width="280" height="280" srcset="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-june-16-2015/Jaakko-Eino-Kalevi-Jaakko-Eino-Kalevi.jpg 280w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-june-16-2015/Jaakko-Eino-Kalevi-Jaakko-Eino-Kalevi-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 280px) 100vw, 280px" /></a><strong>Jaakko Eino Kalevi &#8211; <em>Jaakko Eino Kalevi</em></strong></p>
<p>A Finnish electronic artist, Jaakko Eino Kalevi makes electro pop full of moving color.  His self titled debut (self titled in part because as he told Domino Records &#8220;<span class="ng-isolate-scope">I get my name misspelled so often that I think it’s good to focus on that at this point</span>&#8220;) is a chilled out mix of funk and psychedelic pop that feels like you&#8217;re listening to a vivid dream on a hot summer night.  Album closer &#8220;Ikuinen Purkautumaton Jännite&#8221;, which features horns and what sounds vaguely like a theremin, but is probably synth produced, is particularly trippy and excellent.</p>

<p>In May 2014, as he was preparing to write and record Unknown Mortal Orchestra&#8217;s third album, Ruban Nielson and his wife welcomed a third person into their home and marriage.  Due to United States immigration laws, Nielson and his wife have since returned to being a traditional couple, but as the title makes clear, the experience of 2014 had a massive influence on <em>Multi-Love</em>.  The album&#8217;s music is the familiar psych pop of UMO&#8217;s first two releases, but the lyrics focus largely on Nielson&#8217;s emotions as he attempted to navigate a summer of polyamory.  Taken together, the music and lyrics form an incredibly raw whole that is both beautiful and terrifying.<span id="more-5064"></span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-may-26-2015/AAP-Rocky-At.Long_.Last_.AAP_-e1432648771625.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5065" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-may-26-2015/AAP-Rocky-At.Long_.Last_.AAP_-e1432648771625.jpg" alt="A$AP Rocky - At.Long.Last.A$AP" width="280" height="280" /></a><strong>A$AP Rocky &#8211; <em>At.Long.Last.A$AP</em></strong></p>
<p>Rocky&#8217;s second major label release dropped at midnight (a week earlier than scheduled, so is that still a surprise release?), and is the epitome of a major label rap record.  Immaculately produced, chock full of guests (Future, M.I.A., Schoolboy Q, Kanye West, Juicy J, Lil Wayne, Mos Def&#8230;Rod Stewart???), and completely lacking in grime, <em>At.Long.Last.A$AP</em> is made to get Rocky to the level for which he&#8217;s seemed destined since breaking on the scene in 2011.  It will succeed in that goal.  <em>A.L.L.A</em> will not be the best hip hop record released in 2015, although it is quite good, but there won&#8217;t be many that will sell more copies.</p>

<p>Boosie Badazz, formerly Lil Boosie, has been releasing southern fried hardcore rap since 2003 (with a gap from 2010-14 due to imprisonment), but <em>Touch Down 2 Cause Hell</em> is his major label debut.  It&#8217;s frankly shocking that a major would sign a guy like Boosie in 2015, and even more shocking it would let him put out a record that fits with his discography, but he actually may owe his signing to the prison stretch.  The &#8216;Free Boosie&#8217; movement that cropped up while he was doing time (he was only ever convicted of drug possession charges, but initially given a total of 12 years prison) greatly increased his profile and created a brand Atlantic felt it could sell.  Whatever the reason, the world needs more artists like Boosie releasing albums like this with major label backing.</p>

<p>Shamir has been the next big thing in dance pop for a minute now, going from unknown to releasing a single on small NYC label Godmode to signing with indie titan XL Recordings in the blink of an eye.  Happily, <em>Ratchet</em> is a worthy capstone to such a meteoric rise.  Largely made up of very of the moment synth and drum machine sounds, but highlighted by Shamir&#8217;s contralto vocals, <em>Ratchet</em> is sexy, smooth, laid back fun.  In other words, it&#8217;s summer party music at its finest.<span id="more-5010"></span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-may-19-2015/Hot-Chip-Why-Make-Sense.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5011" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-may-19-2015/Hot-Chip-Why-Make-Sense.jpg" alt="Hot Chip - Why Make Sense" width="280" height="280" srcset="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-may-19-2015/Hot-Chip-Why-Make-Sense.jpg 280w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-may-19-2015/Hot-Chip-Why-Make-Sense-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 280px) 100vw, 280px" /></a><strong>Hot Chip &#8211; <em>Why Make Sense?</em></strong></p>
<p>Continuing their experiments in electronic dance music with live instrumentation, <em>Why Make Sense?</em> is Hot Chip&#8217;s sixth full length.  As with their other albums, most of <em>Why Make Sense?</em>&#8216;s experiments work (&#8220;Need You Now&#8221; and &#8220;Huarache Lights&#8221; are particularly good), but some fall flat (Posdnuos&#8217; verse in &#8220;Love is the Future&#8221;, while good on its own, does not work in context).  On the whole, though, this is a thoroughly enjoyable album that will more than serve the purpose of getting the dance floor moving.</p>

<p>Wales&#8217; Joanna Gruesome make DIY garage/noise pop that fits in perfectly with their labelmates at Slumberland (especially The Pains of Being Pure at Heart), and the band&#8217;s sophomore album, <em>Peanut Butter</em>, is 10 tracks of pure bliss.  The vocals are melodic and sugary, the guitars are fuzzy, and the rhythm section is on point.  In fact, if there&#8217;s any complaint about <em>Peanut Butter</em> it&#8217;s that its 21 minutes simply go by too fast.</p>
<p>Also out today: Holly Herndon &#8211; <em>Platform</em>, Brandon Flowers &#8211; <em>The Desired Effect</em>, Tanlines &#8211; <em>Highlights</em>, The Helio Sequence &#8211; <em>s/t</em>, and Faith No More &#8211; <em>Sol Invictus</em>.</p>

<p>Swede Kristian Matsson has been making singer/songwriter folk as The Tallest Man on Earth since 2006, but <em>Dark Bird is Home</em> is easily his grandest.  Featuring a full band for the first time, including horns and even some electronics, Matsson has added a richness and depth to his music that often puts the album more in the vein of The Decemberists than his usual comparison of Bon Iver.  His true strength, however, remains as a poet, and the album is chock full of wordplay like &#8220;And I&#8217;ve already grown up here, here I might as well grow down&#8221; (from &#8220;Little Nowhere Towns&#8221;).  This combination of orchestration and lyrics makes <em>Dark Bird is Home</em> an absolute gem.<span id="more-5002"></span></p>

<p><strong>Blanck Mass &#8211; <em>Dumb Flesh</em></strong></p>
<p>A side project of Fuck Buttons&#8217; Benjamin John Power, Blanck Mass makes electronic post rock/drone that is more abstract than Power&#8217;s main group, but fans of Fuck Buttons will continue to find a lot to love on Blanck Mass&#8217; second release.  The album is largely made up of heavy drum machine, synth drones, and electronic chirps and flourishes, with label Sacred Bones <a href="http://www.sacredbonesrecords.com/products/sbr136-blanck-mass-dumb-flesh" target="_blank">describing it</a> as &#8220;a comment on the flaws of the human form in its current evolutionary state.&#8221; That&#8217;s an awful lot to glean from 53 minutes of instrumental experiments, but <em>Dumb Flesh</em> is nonetheless a seriously enjoyable listen even if its meaning is elusive.</p>

<p>Tacky, trashy, and scuzzy, Guantanamo Baywatch make surf, garage rock inspired by bands like The Trashmen, The Sonics, and The Cramps, and does so for one reason only: It&#8217;s fun.  <em>Darling&#8230;It&#8217;s Too Late</em> is the trio&#8217;s second widely available full length (although there are earlier recordings out there), and takes an &#8220;if it ain&#8217;t broke, don&#8217;t fix it&#8221; mentality to the group&#8217;s formula.  There&#8217;s reverb and lots of tenor on the guitars, vocal harmonies, and a rawness to the music that makes <em>Darling&#8230;It&#8217;s Too Late</em> perfect for hanging out on a summer&#8217;s day.</p>
<p>Also out today: Pfarmers &#8211; <em>Gunnera</em>, Snoop Dogg &#8211; <em>BUSH</em>, and Tyondai Braxton &#8211; <em>HIVE1</em>.</p>
