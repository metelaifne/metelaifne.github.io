				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Can it be a year since the last list? Here goes with my favorite 20 releases of 2017. Your tastes are not mine, you will disagree, but maybe there is something here that you might not have discovered, something of beauty that might bring you joy. At one point I thought this might be a thin year; when I got down to making the list I realized there was no filler at the bottom. Exact placement is fuzzy – there are lots of apples and oranges being compared here. Feel free to move any of these up or down a few places in your head.</p>
<p><a href="https://12kmusic.bandcamp.com/album/somi"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5412" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/top-20-of-2017-david-smith/Somi-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="200" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/top-20-of-2017-david-smith/Somi-300x300.jpg 300w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/top-20-of-2017-david-smith/Somi-150x150.jpg 150w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/top-20-of-2017-david-smith/Somi.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" /></a><strong>#1. Taylor Deupree – Somi</strong></p>
<p>Deupree’s <em>Faint</em> from a few years ago is still one of my regular listens and pleasures, and I wonder with hindsight if I should have placed it at number one that year. He gave me another chance with the magnificent, meditative <em>Somi</em>. Loops of single notes from acoustic instruments played at varying intervals are layered and treated to create a fascinating slow dance of beauty and rest. And the deluxe edition packaging was as gorgeous as the music. (<a href="https://12kmusic.bandcamp.com/album/somi">Listen</a>)</p>

<p><strong>#2. Daniel Herskedal – The Roc</strong></p>
<p>Norwegian tubaist Herskedal’s new album adds an Arabic influence to his tuba-based jazz-folk explorations. The result is a unique, at times magical set of tunes high in atmosphere and richly colored. Several parts of this album stayed in my head all year. (<a href="https://danielherskedal.bandcamp.com/album/the-roc">Listen</a>)</p>

<p><a href="https://dronarivm.bandcamp.com/album/avifaunal"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5429" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/top-20-of-2017-david-smith/Pausal-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/top-20-of-2017-david-smith/Pausal-150x150.jpg 150w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/top-20-of-2017-david-smith/Pausal-300x300.jpg 300w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/top-20-of-2017-david-smith/Pausal-768x768.jpg 768w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/top-20-of-2017-david-smith/Pausal-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/top-20-of-2017-david-smith/Pausal.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>#3. Pausal – Avifaunal</strong></p>
<p>Pausal’s warm and finely textured drones have been growing on me the last few years. This year’s release took things up a notch, with a sweeping grandeur and narrative flow that make each minute count. An album to get lost in. (<a href="https://dronarivm.bandcamp.com/album/avifaunal">Listen</a>)</p>

<p><strong>#4. Anat Cohen Tentet – Happy Song</strong></p>
<p>The title and bright yellow cover are apt. New York-based Israeli clarinetist Cohen and her ensemble deliver a vibrantly grooving set of jazz romps that shift in character as the album progresses while maintaining an infectious sense of joy. (<a href="http://anzicstore.com/album/happy-song">Listen</a>)</p>

<p><strong>#5. Tinariwen – Elwan</strong></p>
<p>The Saharan blues return with the latest from the great Tuareg band, and it’s one of their finest. The sinuous, swaying rhythms undergird starkly poetic laments at the loss of social and environmental fabric.

<p><strong>#6. Seldom Sene Recorder Consort – Goldberg Variations</strong></p>
<p>As the title gives away, this is the Goldberg Variations played on recorders by a Dutch recorder consort. In addition to the virtuoso playing, the different sonorities of the wind instruments made the Goldbergs sparkle for me in a gentle and delightful new way.

<p><strong>#7. Otto A. Totland – The Lost</strong></p>
<p>Very similar in spirit to its predecessor, <em>Pinô</em>, this second album of piano solos again showcases Norwegian pianist Otto Totland’s ability to conjure a gentle, plaintive warmth through small melodies and soft sounds. (<a href="https://ottoatotland.bandcamp.com/">Listen</a>)</p>

<p><a href="https://chiheihatakeyama.bandcamp.com/album/sora"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5413" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/top-20-of-2017-david-smith/Sora-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/top-20-of-2017-david-smith/Sora-150x150.jpg 150w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/top-20-of-2017-david-smith/Sora-300x300.jpg 300w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/top-20-of-2017-david-smith/Sora-768x768.jpg 768w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/top-20-of-2017-david-smith/Sora-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/top-20-of-2017-david-smith/Sora.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>#8. Chihei Hatakeyama &amp; Federico Durand – Sora</strong></p>
<p>Combining Hatakeyama’s characteristic gossamer tonal washes and Durand’s delightfully pattering small sounds is a recipe for enormous prettiness, and that is just what we get on this deeply calming album. (<a href="https://chiheihatakeyama.bandcamp.com/album/sora">Listen</a>)</p>

<p><strong>#9. The Green Kingdom – The North Wind and the Sun</strong></p>
<p>The Green Kingdom has issued a long series of recordings offering an attractive world of delicate small sounds and textures. This release feels like something fresh as it bursts forth into uplifting melody thanks to the foregrounded guitar work.

<p><strong>#10. Emile Parisien, Vincent Peirani, Andreas Schaerer &amp; Michael Wollny – Out of Land</strong></p>
<p>An unusual but top-notch European jazz combo consisting of sax, accordion, piano, and vocalizations/beatboxing. The live recordings prickle with energy and abound in creativity, making for an exciting listen. (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAKio4qfeqM">Watch</a>)</p>

<p><strong>#11. Fieldhead – We’ve All Been Swimming</strong></p>
<p>Fieldhead’s latest is by far my favorite by the artist so far. It plays with odd rhythmic combinations, layering looping synth melodies over divergent rhythms. The result is a kind of mellow fascination, and great fun. (<a href="https://homeassemblymusic.bandcamp.com/album/weve-all-been-swimming">Listen</a>)</p>

<p><strong>#12. Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark – The Punishment of Luxury</strong></p>
<p>Not much pop makes my lists, but I loved OMD as a teen, and this new release sounds as if it could have been the immediate follow up to 1983’s <em>Dazzle Ships</em>. It nails what made their original Kraftwerk-with-soul sound special, and that made me grin. (<a href="https://officialomd.bandcamp.com/releases">Listen</a>)</p>

<p><strong>#13. Rudresh Mahanthappa/Indo-Pak Coalition – Agrima </strong></p>

<p><strong>#14. Helge Lien Trio – Guzuguzu</strong></p>
<p>With track titles drawn from Japanese onomatopoeia, Helge Lien’s latest piano trio album is made up of moody evocations of atmosphere and movement, often skirting around song structures. Sparkling piano breaks through like rays of sunlight. (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u8uNWIroJQ">Watch</a>)</p>

<p><strong>#15. Porya Hatami – Monads</strong></p>
<p>When I posted my review of this to Facebook none of my friends hit “like,” and it is admittedly a pretty abstract set of experiments with sound rather than a collection of tunes. But they are fascinating experiments, glimpses into the push-and-pull of forces that make the world a place with sound.

<p><strong>#16. Yazz Ahmed – La Saboteuse</strong></p>
<p>Ahmed is a British-Bahraini trumpeter who here successfully melds Arabic motifs, electronic treatments, and jazz trumpet in a set of beguiling tunes. (<a href="https://yazzahmed.bandcamp.com/album/la-saboteuse-2">Listen</a>)</p>

<p><strong>#17. Alea Saxophone Quartet – Arvo Pärt: Anima</strong></p>
<p>If the idea of Pärt played on saxophones conjures up a mental collision of ethereal voices and ill-chosen skronking, think again. The pure tones and harmonies of the sax quartet evocatively capture the spirit of Pärt’s austere choral pieces. (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjbB3NPiL1QTbsipfDysz0M1KRCfMzeLD">Listen</a>)</p>

<p><strong>#18. Taylor Deupree &amp; Marcus Fischer – Lowlands</strong></p>
<p>Building on previous outings as a duo, Deupree and Fischer again show a mastery of the microscopic world of small resonances, adding another delightful release to their growing oeuvre. (<a href="https://12kmusic.bandcamp.com/album/lowlands">Listen</a>)</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://brotundsterne.bandcamp.com/releases"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5419" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/top-20-of-2017-david-smith/Brot-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/top-20-of-2017-david-smith/Brot-150x150.jpg 150w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/top-20-of-2017-david-smith/Brot-300x300.jpg 300w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/top-20-of-2017-david-smith/Brot.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a></strong></p>
<p><strong>#19. Brot &amp; Sterne – Tales of Herbst</strong></p>
<p>This was not quite like anything else I listened to, which is perhaps not surprising in the case of a hurdy-gurdy/hang drum/trumpet jazz trio. The improvised instrumentals set warmly tuneful passages amid unique and atmospheric textures. (<a href="https://brotundsterne.bandcamp.com/releases">Listen</a>)</p>

<p><strong>#20. Billow Observatory – II: Plains/Patterns </strong></p>
<p>More active than their debut release, this collection of ambient pieces pulses and shimmers airily. Enjoyable throughout. (<a href="https://billowobservatory.bandcamp.com/album/ii-plains-patterns">Listen</a>)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>The next 10&#8230;</strong></p>
<p>And here are ten more that I had a really hard time cutting to get the list down to 20. Some of these jumped in and out of my list several times, and might have made it if I had finalized the list tomorrow. Alphabetically:</p>
<p>Wil Bolton – Night Paths (Ambient)</p>
<p>Bruce Cockburn – Bone on Bone (Folk)</p>
<p>Marcus Fischer – Loss (Ambient)</p>
<p>From the Mouth of the Sun – Hymn Binding (Modern Classical)</p>
<p>Ian Hawgood &amp; Wil Bolton – Transparencies (Ambient)</p>
<p>Hudson – Hudson (Jazz)</p>
<p>Rafael Anton Irisarri – The Shameless Years (Ambient)</p>
<p>Benedikt Jahnel Trio – The Invariant (Piano jazz)</p>
<p>Darren McClure – Nature Mirror (Ambient)</p>
<p>Phronesis, Julian Argüelles, &amp; Frankfurt Radio Big Band – The Behemoth (Jazz)</p>
<p>As ever, if any of the artists happen by, thank you for another year of inspiring music.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As I prepared <a href="http://musicisgood.org/2016/12/top-20-of-2016-david-smith/">this year&#8217;s top 20 list</a>, I discovered that several of my favorite releases this year were not full albums, but brief EPs. Including them in the top 20 albums list felt a bit like trying to compare novels and short stories, so I decided to list them separately. These were my top 5 favorite EPs of 2016:</p>

A wonderful surprise at the end of the year: three Pjusk collaborations. Loscil, Porya Hatami, and SHAO add their musical perspectives, and the distinctive sound of Pjusk remains present in each track. Brilliant stuff.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Fifteen minutes of warm, spacious, crackly, resonant, luxuriant sound. My favorite of Wil Bolton&#8217;s several releases this year. Check out his <a href="https://wilbolton.bandcamp.com/album/maemi"><em>Maemi</em></a> EP and the full-length <em><a href="https://wilbolton.bandcamp.com/album/february-dawn">February Dawn</a> </em>as well.</p>

My list had its share of gentleness this year, but for moments when something more hard-edged fit the bill, this short collection of rumbling minimalist techno in the classic raster-noton vein was an excellent stand-by.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><br />
<img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5363" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/top-20-of-2016-david-smith/Murcof-EP01-150x150.jpg" alt="murcof-ep01" width="150" height="150" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/top-20-of-2016-david-smith/Murcof-EP01-150x150.jpg 150w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/top-20-of-2016-david-smith/Murcof-EP01-300x300.jpg 300w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/top-20-of-2016-david-smith/Murcof-EP01.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" />#4. <a href="https://infine-rec.bandcamp.com/album/ep01">Murcof and Vanessa Wagner &#8211; EP01</a></strong><br />
By turns darkly brooding and gently melancholy, this turbulent-electronics-meets-Satie release stuck with me even after the full-length album that followed it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5364" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/top-20-of-2016-david-smith/Jazzdefector-150x150.jpg" alt="jazzdefector" width="150" height="150" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/top-20-of-2016-david-smith/Jazzdefector-150x150.jpg 150w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/top-20-of-2016-david-smith/Jazzdefector-300x300.jpg 300w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/top-20-of-2016-david-smith/Jazzdefector.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /><strong>#5. <a href="https://audiogourmet.bandcamp.com/album/miniatures">Jazzdefector &#8211; Miniatures</a></strong></p>
<p>Finally, something more relaxing. A series of very short pieces of effects-laden guitar offer a summery interlude, warm and pretty.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s been a quiet 2016 at <em>Music is Good</em>. Professional commitments have left some regulars with less time for blogging. But we&#8217;re still listening. Here are my top 20 albums for 2016. I excluded compilations (though <a href="http://shop.serein.co.uk/album/orbital-planes-passenger-trains-vol-1"><em>Orbital Planes &amp; Passenger Trains, Vol. 1</em></a> from Serein, <a href="https://dronarivm.bandcamp.com/album/into-the-white-new-years-2016-free-compilation"><em>Into the White</em></a> from Dronarivm, and <a href="https://www.fat-cat.co.uk/release/eleven-into-fifteen-a-130701-compilation"><em>Eleven into Fifteen</em></a> from 130701 all delighted me). As ever, this is the best in my subjective judgment of what I heard and liked, no more, and the numbering is less important than the chance of helping someone find something good that they missed. This year I am treating EPs separately, <a href="http://musicisgood.org/?p=5331&#038;preview=true">in a second post</a>.<span id="more-5329"></span></p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5357" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/top-20-of-2016-david-smith/durand-traves-150x150.jpg" alt="durand-traves" width="200" height="200" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/top-20-of-2016-david-smith/durand-traves-150x150.jpg 150w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/top-20-of-2016-david-smith/durand-traves-300x300.jpg 300w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/top-20-of-2016-david-smith/durand-traves.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" /></p>
<p><strong>#1.</strong> <a href="https://federicodurand.bandcamp.com/album/a-trav-s-del-espejo"><strong>Federico Durand – A Través Del Espejo</strong></a><br />
This delightful album was released on 12k early in the year, and I kept listening to it all year. (My wife liked it too, which is far from guaranteed with the more experimental fringes of my listening.) A childlike celebration of tiny, fragile sounds, and a reminder of what can be destroyed by noise and bombast, this album offers a series of delicate meditations on the vulnerable beauty of sound. Durand&#8217;s <a href="https://federicodurand.bandcamp.com/"><em>Jardín de invierno</em></a> (on Spekk) deserves honorable mention in the same vein, but it was this earlier release that captivated my ears the most this year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5346" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/top-20-of-2016-david-smith/nicolas-jaar-150x150.jpg" alt="nicolas-jaar" width="150" height="150" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/top-20-of-2016-david-smith/nicolas-jaar-150x150.jpg 150w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/top-20-of-2016-david-smith/nicolas-jaar-300x300.jpg 300w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/top-20-of-2016-david-smith/nicolas-jaar-768x768.jpg 768w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/top-20-of-2016-david-smith/nicolas-jaar-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/top-20-of-2016-david-smith/nicolas-jaar.jpg 1440w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>#2. <a href="https://play.spotify.com/album/2EvZiOMBlC9b5hbjbZCjZv?play=true&#038;utm_source=open.spotify.com&#038;utm_medium=open">Nicolas Jaar &#8211; Sirens</a></strong><br />
The haunting first track displays magnificently Jaar&#8217;s precise mastery of his palette of sounds. The album continues with a compelling sideways take on a variety of song forms, with the thematic focus on a culture of political violence providing a dark textual undercurrent. A remarkable piece of work, whether one focuses on the catchy songs, on the textual warnings, or on the meticulously shaped sonic shifts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5351" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/top-20-of-2016-david-smith/Sunergy-Smith-150x150.jpg" alt="sunergy-smith" width="150" height="150" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/top-20-of-2016-david-smith/Sunergy-Smith-150x150.jpg 150w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/top-20-of-2016-david-smith/Sunergy-Smith-300x300.jpg 300w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/top-20-of-2016-david-smith/Sunergy-Smith.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></p>
<p>#<strong>3. <a href="https://kaitlynaureliasmith.bandcamp.com/album/frkwys-vol-13-sunergy">Kaitlyn Aurelia Smith &amp; Suzanne Ciani &#8211; Sunergy</a></strong><br />
An inspired set of Buchla synthesizer improvisations from a senior master of the art and a new rising star (Smith&#8217;s solo album <a href="https://kaitlynaureliasmith.bandcamp.com/album/ears"><em>Ears</em></a> this year was also excellent). Sequences burble and sparkle over shifting hums and currents, providing a compelling update to the long-form analog synthesizer genre.</p>

What if Brian Eno&#8217;s classic ambient work, <em>Music for Airports,</em> were recorded as a jazz album? Chris Schlarb showed us this year that the results could be very enjoyable indeed. We also get a new, complementary piece, the &#8220;working man&#8217;s counterpart&#8221; to music for airports titled &#8220;Music for Bus Stops.&#8221; Both pieces charmed me.</p>

An acoustic guitar meanders gently and peacefully as an unsettled bed of chirping, buzzing, warbling, squeaking electronics chatters tensely alongside, setting up a fascinating conversation that sometimes produces tension, sometimes converges.</p>

Building on last year&#8217;s <em>Still</em>, M. Ostermeier returned with an aptly titled collection of short, plaintive piano pieces. Accompanied by background rustles and rattles, the tracks are sparse, stark, melancholy, almost hesitant in their deliberation. The sound is intimate, inviting us to slow down and attend rather than carrying us along.</p>

David Newman&#8217;s recent releases have struck an absorbing balance between experimental exploration of the properties of sound and a melodic presence, and this collaboration with Justin Varis continues in the same rich vein. Remixes by various luminaries of the genre add a further dimension to this charming collection of off-kilter pieces.</p>

Korwar takes field recordings of folk music from Indian villages and marries them with jazz and electronics so skilfully that it is hard to see the joins. Raw recordings of chant and percussion from India provide the substrate that morphs into engaging jazz sequences that extend the sources without leaving them behind. A striking, unusual release.</p>

Loscil continues to find new angles on his distinctive sound, and his latest contains some of his most aggressive rhythms to date. It also serves up a fresh helping of his signature hypnotically shimmering pulses. I have never met a Loscil album I didn&#8217;t like, and this latest release more than kept the streak going.</p>

Resonant guitar notes follow one another at a gentle, leisurely pace. An ethereal atmosphere builds amid their resonance. Chiming rhythms eventually arrive, but only accentuate the calm. The album drifts by lazily, a slow caress.</p>

An evocative follow-up to Tiento de las Nieves, Tiento de la Luz offers a glacially paced interaction of piano, viola da gamba, and electronics. As usual with Köner, deep frequencies and extended textures play an important role, with the decay of each note held before us for contemplation. Mesmerizing listening.</p>

A rich, undulating, 35-minute drone, embedded in field recordings of the ocean, gains texture from the use of bass and contrabass clarinet along with electronics. Deep rumbles and whale-song-like squeaks ebb, and flow, and sway to deeply atmospheric effect.</p>

<p>The Native American sonic references may be a little hokey here and there, but the more I listened to this release from French jazz bass veteran Henri Texier the more the tunes sank their hooks into me.

<p>Piano again, now heard through a rich haze of sonic manipulation, tinkling amid a crackle and rush of air, emerging from a busy hum, chiming like bells, meandering sadly, punctuating an ominous buzz.

This is not background music. It seems at any given moment as if little is happening, yet the whole unfolds in a way that feels tautly dramatic, like a small movie made of slight violin scrapes, hisses, metallic reverberations, wordless vocalizations, the sounds of something important happening, just over the horizon and almost out of earshot.</p>

Nils Frahm got together with some childhood friends to revisit and remix some tapes they had made decades ago. The result is a collection of atmospheric lo-fi instrumentals that somehow manage to sound reminiscent of Frahm&#8217;s solo work while being little like his previous material in form.</p>

McClure trades more in precise measures of sound than in tunes. Each track on this immersive, painstakingly crafted album invites the listener to meditate on a specific quality of carefully constructed sound, ranging from the nature-tinged water-and-hum of the opening track to almost-not-there gossamer drones and unexpected pulses.</p>

There are stretches in which this album sounds like a gaggle of synthesizers improvising by themselves, without human intervention. Bright, chiming sounds ripple and cascade merrily. Stick around, though, and the two long pieces begin to develop and morph, building into rich swathes of sound.</p>

Drone and noise, crackle and hum, chaotic dissolution of sound and a massive sense of grandeur &#8211; these are the basic building blocks of <em>Continuum</em>.

The practically ungooglable title gave me some trouble tracking down this unusual release. It began from recordings of the sounds of bees in their hives and built instrumental compositions around the bee drones and buzzes. The music is pastoral, and the interweaving of natural and instrumental sounds is quite sensitively done.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here is my top 20 music releases for 2015, with no claim that they are somehow objectively the best or that I listened to everything anyone else did. I have found things that delighted me on other people’s lists, and the point of the exercise is not to replicate or compete with those lists but to highlight some things you may not have found, things that might delight you. The sequence changed every time I made a shortlist, so take the numbers with a pinch of salt – all of them could be at least plus or minus 5 on a given day.<span id="more-5218"></span></p>
<p><img class="alignleft wp-image-5195" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/review-inscriptions-by-wil-bolton/Inscriptions-150x150.jpg" alt="Inscriptions" width="200" height="200" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/review-inscriptions-by-wil-bolton/Inscriptions-150x150.jpg 150w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/review-inscriptions-by-wil-bolton/Inscriptions.jpg 280w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>#1.</strong> <strong>Wil Bolton – Inscriptions</strong><br />
I have loved many of Wil Bolton’s releases, and this one was especially captivating, a cohesive suite of carefully textured ambient soundscapes of great warmth and delicacy. A delight for the ears from start to finish. Full review <a href="http://musicisgood.org/2015/12/review-inscriptions-by-wil-bolton/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5234" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Nils-Frahm-150x150.jpg" alt="Nils Frahm" width="150" height="150" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Nils-Frahm-150x150.jpg 150w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Nils-Frahm-300x300.jpg 300w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Nils-Frahm.jpg 512w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>#2. Nils Frahm – Solo</strong><br />
Nils Frahm has had a prolific year, including a film score and electronic duets with Ólafur Arnalds, but where he remains unrivaled is as a painter of fragile intimacy on the piano. This collection of solo piano pieces did not disappoint, offering both slow affection and rhythmic drive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5233" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Kari-Ikonen-150x150.jpg" alt="Kari Ikonen" width="150" height="150" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Kari-Ikonen-150x150.jpg 150w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Kari-Ikonen.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>#<strong>3. Kari Ikonen Trio &#8211; Beauteous Tales and Offbeat Stories</strong><br />
From scampering piano romps to meditative arco bass passages, from stately melodies to discordant experimental interludes, this album charms with its variety and adds another thread to my fondness for Scandinavian piano jazz.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5229" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Hatami-mcclure-150x150.jpg" alt="Hatami mcclure" width="150" height="150" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Hatami-mcclure-150x150.jpg 150w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Hatami-mcclure.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" />#4. Porya Hatami and Darren Mcclure – In-Between Spaces</strong><br />
A delicious marriage of McClure’s abstract tones and Hatami’s gently burbling textures, this joint essay in textured ambiance is gently reflective in mood, a continual, fragile, questing movement within a basic rest. Another excellent release for Hatami, and a fine companion to McClure’s excellent Primary Locations from earlier in the year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5225" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Den-Sorte-Skole-150x150.jpg" alt="Den Sorte Skole" width="150" height="150" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Den-Sorte-Skole-150x150.jpg 150w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Den-Sorte-Skole.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" />#5. Den Sorte Skole – Indians and Cowboys</strong><br />
Den Sorte Skole take thousands of small samples from old vinyl records and weave them into eclectic tapestries in which they become a cohesive, dappled, new whole. An unerring sense of groove is married to sounds and voices from the past and around the world. Get it for free at the artists’ site <a href="http://densorteskole.net/">here</a>.</p>

Esmerine &#8211; Lost Voices</strong><br />
Marimba, percussion and strings are the backbone of Esmerine’s moody miniatures. The music sometimes shares the ponderous majesty of related bands godspeed you! black emperor and Thee Silver Mt. Zion, but its idiom is more acoustic, rooted in marimba, strings and drums. Lost Voices builds gentle rhythms, passages of lyrical beauty, and outbreaks of restrained melodic intensity into a wistful and dramatic whole, arguably their best yet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5226" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Emily-Hall-150x150.jpg" alt="Emily Hall" width="150" height="150" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Emily-Hall-150x150.jpg 150w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Emily-Hall-300x300.jpg 300w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Emily-Hall-768x768.jpg 768w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Emily-Hall-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Emily-Hall.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" />#7. Emily Hall – Folie à Deux</strong><br />
Ostensibly an opera about shared delusion and receiving cosmic messages from an electricity pylon, this charming release sounds more like ambient than opera. Pure, melodic voices meditate dreamily on madness and our relationship to each other and the world that speaks through our electric technologies to the accompaniment of electronic textures, creating a mesmerizing and delightful sound.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5232" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Kangding-Ray-150x150.jpeg" alt="Kangding Ray" width="150" height="150" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Kangding-Ray-150x150.jpeg 150w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Kangding-Ray-300x300.jpeg 300w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Kangding-Ray.jpeg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" />#8. Kangding Ray – Cory Arcane</strong><br />
I expected this year’s blockbuster from the raster-noton label to be Alva Noto’s Xerrox 3 (which I liked, but am still growing to love), but in the short term at least was more impacted by Kangding Ray’s uneasily skittering techno. Intricate rhythms shift and collide, accompanied by a narrative about the decay of consumerist technological society yet carrying a visceral appeal as pure sound.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5222" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Autistici-150x150.jpg" alt="Autistici" width="150" height="150" />#9. Autistici – Temporal Enhancement</strong><br />
Abstract in concept (an exploration of our perception of sound in its relation to time) and in execution (a focus on sounds themselves and their tensions with one another), this album nevertheless also manages to cohere as a compelling and finely wrought listening experience. The second entry on this list from the Dronarivm label, which had a fine year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5224" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Dag-Rosenqvist-150x150.jpg" alt="Dag Rosenqvist" width="150" height="150" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Dag-Rosenqvist-150x150.jpg 150w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Dag-Rosenqvist-300x300.jpg 300w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Dag-Rosenqvist-768x768.jpg 768w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Dag-Rosenqvist-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Dag-Rosenqvist.jpg 1181w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" />#10. Dag Rosenqvist – The Forest Diaries</strong><br />
Rosenqvist had a busy year, but charmed me most with this disarmingly simple set of piano/organ meditations that combine stillness with an undercurrent of dissonance. Notes are allowed to linger and decay, giving time to absorb and reflect. Music for a thoughtful evening.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5241" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Deupree-150x150.jpg" alt="Deupree" width="150" height="150" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Deupree-150x150.jpg 150w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Deupree-300x300.jpg 300w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Deupree.jpg 590w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" />#11. Taylor Deupree and Marcus Fischer – Twine</strong><br />
Another serving of the distinctive kind of microscopic beauty that Deupree’s 12k label has been honing for many years now. Gently hissing tape loops undulate their way softly through time, sparsely dusted with gentle chimes and wobbles, seeping softly into the future.</p>

<p><strong>#12. En – City of Brides</strong><br />
En’s follow up to the excellent Already Gone uses their distinctive palette to good effect. Passages of calmly undulating drones sit in tension with densely layered flurries of sound that reach for a cascading majesty, all heard through a dreamy, blurring filter. A distinctive world to get lost in. Full review<a href="http://musicisgood.org/2015/12/review-city-of-brides-by-en/"> here</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5236" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Seckou-Keita-150x150.jpg" alt="Seckou Keita" width="150" height="150" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Seckou-Keita-150x150.jpg 150w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Seckou-Keita.jpg 280w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></p>
<p><strong>#13 Seckou Keita &#8211; 22 Strings</strong></p>
<p>This album offers elegant, and life-affirming instrumentals by a master kora-player from Senegal, a few of them accompanied by gentle vocals. African and Western sensibilities interweave in the compositions, and the sound is delicate and warmly inviting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5228" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Goldmund-150x150.jpg" alt="Goldmund" width="150" height="150" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Goldmund-150x150.jpg 150w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Goldmund-300x300.jpg 300w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Goldmund.jpg 355w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></p>
<p><strong>#14 Goldmund &#8211; Sometimes</strong></p>
<p>Another entry in the atmospheric piano miniatures genre, this deeply melodic and contemplative album combines the gentle piano gestures with light electronic washes to create a beautiful sonic landscape that invites introspection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5235" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Port-st-willow-150x150.jpg" alt="Port st willow" width="150" height="150" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Port-st-willow-150x150.jpg 150w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Port-st-willow-300x300.jpg 300w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Port-st-willow.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" />#15. Port St. Willow – Syncope</strong><br />
The instrumentation here is sparse and restrained, the falsetto vocal plaintive. Patient percussion, punctuating flutters of guitar and electronics, and the undulating melodies create an atmosphere that reminds me of late-period, post-pop Talk Talk.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5230" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Ian-William-Craig-150x150.png" alt="Ian William Craig" width="150" height="150" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Ian-William-Craig-150x150.png 150w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Ian-William-Craig-300x300.png 300w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Ian-William-Craig-768x768.png 768w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Ian-William-Craig.png 790w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" />#16. Ian William Craig – Cradle for the Wanting</strong><br />
Ian William Craig has spent several albums doggedly refining an unusual recipe – ambient compositions based on varying kinds of manipulation of his trained tenor voice. Cradle for the Wanting is perhaps the purest installment yet, the haunting, wordless vocals dancing with their own sonic decay.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5223" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Chris-Bissonnette-150x150.jpg" alt="Chris Bissonnette" width="150" height="150" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Chris-Bissonnette-150x150.jpg 150w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Chris-Bissonnette-300x300.jpg 300w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Chris-Bissonnette.jpg 745w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" />#17. Christopher Bissonnette &#8211; Pitch, Paper &amp; Foil</strong><br />
Very much in continuity with last year’s Essays in Idleness, this album continues Bissonnette’s move away from his earlier ambient palette and into his engagement with quavering synth soliloquies. I am left feeling as if it is less a matter of playing music on the synth and more of coaxing the synth into speech, drawing forth a fragile voice from it that sings in its own expressive tongue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5231" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Irisarri-150x150.jpg" alt="Irisarri" width="150" height="150" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Irisarri-150x150.jpg 150w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Irisarri.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" />#18. Rafael Anton Irisarri &#8211; A Fragile Geography</strong><br />
Irisarri’s work is consistently worth listening to, and here as always he achieves a depth of texture and grandness of gesture that lend tremendous weight and presence to his dronescapes. Another important release to add to his growing oeuvre.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Alva Noto &#8211; Xerrox Vol 3</strong><br />
Xerrox Vol 2 is an album that I admire greatly, and there was a 6-year wait for its successor; I think my ears were therefore too primed for something similar. Xerrox 3 is more sparse and subdued and yet also more overtly emotive. Like all of Carsten Nicolai’s work it exudes precision and care. I suspect it will continue to grow on me.</p>

<p><strong><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5239" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Vivaldi-150x150.jpg" alt="Vivaldi" width="150" height="150" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Vivaldi-150x150.jpg 150w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Vivaldi-300x300.jpg 300w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Vivaldi.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" />#20. Fabio Biondi &#8211; Vivaldi: I concerti dell&#8217;addio</strong><br />
I ended up listening to a lot of Vivaldi this year after learning that his music didn’t have to be played like the Vivaldi I grew up hearing. Fabio Biondi’s versions of Vivaldi are always vibrant, and this new collection has rich texture and the accustomed verve.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is the first time I&#8217;ve compiled a personal best of the year, and I realise the resulting list says as much about my buying habits as about my taste in classical music. There&#8217;s little you might call the mainstream classical repertoire, because I don&#8217;t often look for more than one recording of a work, and a tight budget has meant some higher-profile releases never reached my ears; moreover, I&#8217;ve also been filling gaps in my collection with older recordings rather than buying new ones. So, give me a month and a couple of hundred euros and it might be a very different list. But let&#8217;s stick with the excellence at hand. The order of the list has changed repeatedly during the compiling, and would presumably continue to do so if I didn&#8217;t stop now.</p>
<p><a href="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-stephen-j-nereffid/12adams.jpg"><img class="alignleft" alt="Adams Harmonielehre" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-stephen-j-nereffid/12adams.jpg" width="150" height="150" /></a>1 <b>John Adams: Harmonielehre</b> <b>&#8211; Michael Tilson Thomas, San Francisco Symphony </b>(SFS Media). In the early 90s, I discovered the music of Gustav Mahler and Philip Glass at roughly the same time. What I didn&#8217;t know then was that a few years earlier John Adams had combined the two (and plenty more besides) in <i>Harmonielehre. </i>The title comes from the treatise of the same name by Schoenberg, but Adams&#8217;s music is a gleeful rejection of Schoenberg&#8217;s aesthetic, a grand mix of influences and references that constantly surprises.<span id="more-3891"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-stephen-j-nereffid/12prezioso.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-3950" alt="Preiozoso Quartet" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-stephen-j-nereffid/12prezioso.jpg" width="120" height="120" /></a>2 <b>Prezioso Quartet</b> (ERP). This quartet&#8217;s members are Estonian, and they&#8217;ve been together since 2006. This is their first recording, and it makes a big splash, with a vivid acoustic and some surprising repertoire. Webern&#8217;s highly uncharacteristic <i>Langsamer Satz</i> and an arrangement of a likeable chamber concerto by Estonian Jaan Rääts are framed by a cheerful dance suite by the not-well-enough-known Erwin Schulhoff and the sublime fourth quartet of Peteris Vasks.</p>
<p><a href="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-stephen-j-nereffid/12russie.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-3951" alt="Voyage en Russie" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-stephen-j-nereffid/12russie.jpg" width="120" height="120" /></a>3 <b>Voyage en Russie &#8211; Claire-Marie Le Guay</b> (Mirare). Basically, a whole bunch of short Russian piano pieces, with a focus on Rachmaninoff and Scriabin. Some of the “greatest hits” are here, but there&#8217;s plenty of unfamiliar music, and it&#8217;s all captivating. Claire-Marie Le Guay brings everything together into a convincing program, from the opening <i>Flight of the Bumblebee</i> to the closing <i>Vers la flamme,</i> Scriabin&#8217;s astonishing depiction of the heat death of the Earth<i>.</i></p>
<p><a href="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-stephen-j-nereffid/12tormis.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-3954" alt="Curse Upon Iron" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-stephen-j-nereffid/12tormis.jpg" width="120" height="120" /></a>4 <b>Veljo Tormis: Curse upon Iron</b> <b>&#8211; Orphei Drangar</b> (BIS). Tormis&#8217;s choral music, of which this selection for male voices represents just a small portion, is firmly rooted in the folk music of his native Estonia. Some of it&#8217;s heart-achingly beautiful, while other pieces tap into stronger, darker forces, such as the shamanic title work (adapted from the Kalevala, the Finnish epic poem), full of chanting and pounding drums. An exhilarating experience.</p>
<p><a href="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-stephen-j-nereffid/12paris.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-3949" alt="Le Paris des Romantiques" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-stephen-j-nereffid/12paris.jpg" width="120" height="120" /></a>5 <b>Le Paris des Romantiques</b> <b>&#8211; Le Cercle de l&#8217;Harmonie/ Jérémie Rhorer</b> (Ambroisie). It&#8217;s hard to decide what&#8217;s the highlight of this imaginary concert from Paris circa 1850, played on period instruments. On the one hand we&#8217;ve got the beautifully clear performance of Liszt&#8217;s first piano concerto, with Bertrand Chamayou playing an 1837 Érard. On the other, there&#8217;s Napoléon Henri Reber&#8217;s fourth symphony, which manages the neat trick of coming across like a long-lost Beethoven composition while simultaneously sounding utterly fresh.</p>
<p><a href="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-stephen-j-nereffid/12morava.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-3947" alt="Morava" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-stephen-j-nereffid/12morava.jpg" width="120" height="120" /></a>6 <b>Morava &#8211; </b><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Š</b></span></span></span><b>kampa Quartet</b> (Supraphon). I kind of surprise myself by having a second quartet disc in my top ten. Most of this release is taken up by the three string quartets of Pavel Fischer, all of which are greatly inspired by folk music from Moravia and elsewhere and full of fascinating twists and turns; the most magical moment is in the quartet &#8220;Wild Mountain Thyme&#8221;, where that Scottish song suddenly emerges at the end of the middle movement. There&#8217;s also a quirky quartet from violinist/singer Iva Bittová, who herself sings on a couple of other pieces.</p>
<p><a href="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-stephen-j-nereffid/12shankar.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-3953" alt="Shankar Symphony" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-stephen-j-nereffid/12shankar.jpg" width="120" height="120" /></a>7 <b>Ravi Shankar: Symphony</b> <b>&#8211; London Philharmonic/David Murphy</b> (LPO). Shankar&#8217;s symphony is indeed a four-movement structure modeled on the traditional classical symphony but employs raga scales and makes considerable use of the sitar, played here by his daughter Anoushka (this is a recording of the work&#8217;s premiere in 2010). I know next to nothing about Indian music so all I can report is that this “sounds Indian”, and I guess it&#8217;s this aspect of the work that lends it a general post-minimalist feel.</p>
<p><a href="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-stephen-j-nereffid/12weinberg6.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-3956" alt="Weinberg Symphony 6" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-stephen-j-nereffid/12weinberg6.jpg" width="120" height="120" /></a>8 <b>Mieczyslaw Weinberg: Symphony no.6</b> <b>&#8211; Vladimir Lande</b> (Naxos). Weinberg&#8217;s star continues to rise, though my explorations are at an early stage and I&#8217;m still inclined to fall back on the description “sounds quite like Shostakovich, with a bit of Mahler thrown in”. In the Sixth Symphony, the composer&#8217;s gift for orchestration is dramatically enhanced by the presence of a boys&#8217; chorus in three of the movements; the music is increasingly troubled but ends with a hopeful lullaby.</p>
<p><a href="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-stephen-j-nereffid/12koshkin.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-3945" alt="Papandreou plays Koshkin" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-stephen-j-nereffid/12koshkin.jpg" width="120" height="120" /></a>9 <b>Elena Papandreou plays Nikita Koshkin</b> (BIS). An intriguing collection of new guitar music from the Russian guitarist/composer, three of the four pieces being written for Papandreou. The lengthy Megaron Concerto is a mostly sombre work, though it sports a very catchy second movement. The quintet for guitar and strings is also rather dark-hued; it&#8217;s all in a thoroughly accessible idiom but you&#8217;ll never mistake it for Boccherini! Overall, an album that patiently creeps up on you.</p>
<p><a href="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-stephen-j-nereffid/12beethoven.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-3940" alt="Diabelli Variations" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-stephen-j-nereffid/12beethoven.jpg" width="120" height="120" /></a>10 <strong>Beethoven: Diabelli variations &#8211; Andreas Staier</strong> (Harmonia Mundi). Beethoven&#8217;s epic adventure brought to spectacular life by Staier, who plays a copy of a Beethoven-era Graf fortepiano that comes with some surprising sound-effects features. These provide bonus entertainment but Staier&#8217;s playing is, of course, the main event. For good measure we get ten other composers&#8217; contributions to Diabelli&#8217;s project; the effort by 13-year-old Franz Liszt is hilariously easy to pick from the line-up.</p>
<p><a href="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-stephen-j-nereffid/12merton.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-3946" alt="Advent at Merton" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-stephen-j-nereffid/12merton.jpg" width="120" height="120" /></a>11 <b>Advent at Merton &#8211; Choir of Merton College, Oxford</b> (Delphian). I&#8217;ll freely admit that English church choirs aren&#8217;t usually something I enjoy, so this one came as a surprise. It&#8217;s a collection of old and new pieces, including seven antiphons commissioned from the likes of John Tavener, Rihards Dubra, and Gabriel Jackson by Merton College&#8217;s chaplain. Old and new combine beautifully in Jan Sandstrom&#8217;s hypnotic reworking of <em>Es ist ein Ros entsprungen</em><em>, </em>but it&#8217;s gorgeous music all round.</p>
<p><a href="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-stephen-j-nereffid/12himmels.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-3943" alt="Himmels-lieder" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-stephen-j-nereffid/12himmels.jpg" width="120" height="120" /></a>12 <b>Himmelslieder &#8211; Franz Vitzthum</b> (Christophorus). An excellent countertenor, in a program of German Baroque cantatas and songs. The collector in me is delighted to add some new composers to the library (Johann Augustin Kobelius and Johann Hildebrand, anyone?); the music lover is thrilled to hear Franz Vitzthum&#8217;s ethereal purity—it floats like no other countertenor I can think of—and the Capricornum Consort Basel&#8217;s sympathetic support.</p>
<p><a href="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-stephen-j-nereffid/12bach.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-3939" alt="Bach guitar" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-stephen-j-nereffid/12bach.jpg" width="120" height="120" /></a>13 <b>Bach guitar transcriptions &#8211; Graham Anthony Devine</b> (Naxos). The miracle of Bach&#8217;s music is that it can be adapted to pretty much any instrument and still sound wonderful. Graham Anthony Devine himself has arranged the fourth cello suite and second violin partita, among other works, and the results seem wholly natural; comparison to the originals is pointless, as this is fine, expressive playing that stands on its own merits.</p>
<p><a href="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-stephen-j-nereffid/12josquin.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-3944" alt="Josquin" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-stephen-j-nereffid/12josquin.jpg" width="120" height="120" /></a>14 <b>Josquin Desprez: Missa Ave maris stella</b> <b>&#8211; Weser Renaissance/Manfred Cordes</b> (CPO). My medieval and renaissance listening this year has mostly been confined to older recordings as I slowly work my way through my <i>History of Classical Music</i>. This is a lovely collection, sung by male voices only, of a mass and several motets by &#8211; as I&#8217;ll hopefully soon get round to describing him &#8211; the greatest of the Franco-Flemish composers.</p>
<p><a href="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-stephen-j-nereffid/12oriada.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-3948" alt="Ó Riada" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-stephen-j-nereffid/12oriada.jpg" width="120" height="120" /></a>15 <b>Seán Ó Riada: Orchestral works</b> (RTÉ). Seán Ó Riada was an important figure in Irish music who died too young, at age 40 in 1971. This is a collection of several orchestral works, including his landmark score for the documentary film <i>Mise Éire, </i>making use of various well-known Irish tunes, and the vibrant <i>Hercules Dux Ferrariae</i>, which combines twelve-note rows with a theme by Josquin and no longer sounds like the forbidding piece I thought it was when I first heard it as a teenager.</p>
<p><a href="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-stephen-j-nereffid/12dowland.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-3941" alt="Dowland in Dublin" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-stephen-j-nereffid/12dowland.jpg" width="120" height="120" /></a>16 <b>Dowland in Dublin &#8211; Michael Slattery &amp; La Nef </b>(Atma). This album takes as its starting point the suggestion (not well supported, it must be said) that English Renaissance composer John Dowland was in fact an Irishman. Here, the American tenor Michael Slattery joins forces with Canadian baroque ensemble La Nef to present some of Dowland&#8217;s lighter music with a distinctly Celtic flavour. There have been sniffs from some quarters that this isn&#8217;t &#8220;authentic&#8221;, which rather misses the point.</p>
<p><a href="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-stephen-j-nereffid/12vivaldi.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-3955" alt="La Cetra" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-stephen-j-nereffid/12vivaldi.jpg" width="120" height="120" /></a>17 <b>Antonio Vivaldi: La Cetra &#8211; Rachel Podger</b><strong> &amp; Holland Baroque Society</strong> (Channel). These twelve concertos aren&#8217;t among Vivaldi&#8217;s most popular, but one listen will make you wonder why. Rachel Podger and the Holland Baroque Society are clearly having a ball here, with music full of incident and invention. We all know there&#8217;s more to Vivaldi than the Four Seasons, but it&#8217;s nice to be vividly reminded. Of the twelve concertos, is there a highlight? Um&#8230; all of them?</p>
<p><a href="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-stephen-j-nereffid/12weinberg20.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-3957" alt="Weinberg Symphony 20" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-stephen-j-nereffid/12weinberg20.jpg" width="120" height="120" /></a>18 <b>Mieczyslaw Weinberg: Symphony no.20; Cello concerto</b> (Chandos). More Weinberg! Thord Svedlund and the Gothenburg Symphony Orchestra&#8217;s recording of Weinberg&#8217;s Third Symphony was my first introduction to the symphonies and became an instant favourite, and their follow-up is also impressive. The symphony (written in 1988) is a dark work that gradually tightens its grip on the listener, while the cello concerto has a beautiful, lyrical first movement that should be much better known.</p>
<p><a href="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-stephen-j-nereffid/12say.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-3952" alt="Istanbul Symphony" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-stephen-j-nereffid/12say.jpg" width="120" height="120" /></a>19 <b>Fazil Say: Istanbul Symphony </b>(Naive). Fine musical picture-painting from the Turkish pianist/composer. The Istanbul Symphony is, in Say&#8217;s words, a picture of “a nostalgic, dreamy, vintage Istanbul” that makes use of Turkish instruments alongside the Western symphony orchestra. Its partner on the disc is the Hezarfen Concerto for ney (a Turkish flute, played by Burcu Karadağ) commemorating the man who is claimed to have glided across the Bosphorus in 1632 using wings of his own construction.</p>
<p><a href="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-stephen-j-nereffid/12goethe.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-3942" alt="Goethe Lieder" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-stephen-j-nereffid/12goethe.jpg" width="120" height="120" /></a>20<b> Goethe Lieder &#8211; Marlis Petersen</b> (Harmonia Mundi). Schubert and Wolf are the obvious choices for a program of Goethe settings, and they&#8217;re here, but the particular value of this set comes from the appearance of less-obvious pieces, with composers ranging from Fanny Mendelssohn to Charles Ives to Manfred Trojahn. Multiple versions of “Wanderers Nachtlied” shed light on how different composers deal with the same text.</p>
<p>Finally, I must highlight two pieces of music from albums that didn&#8217;t make the cut. Pedro Sanjuán was a Basque conductor and composer who spent a decade in Cuba. The slow movement of his orchestral work <i>Castilla</i> is a gorgeous, sinuous piece with a saxophone tune that&#8217;s a first cousin of Ravel&#8217;s <i>Bolero</i>. The rest of the album from the Basque National Orchestra is fine, but this movement—<i>En la llanura—</i>gets my award for favourite individual track of the year.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the award for best musical depiction of a dog in a spaceship goes to Jon Øivind Ness&#8217;s <i>Zvezdochka in Orbit,</i> an alarmingly vivid portrait for cello and wind band of what Yuri Gagarin&#8217;s immediate predecessor might have experienced in her capsule. It heads a very varied program played by Ernst Simon Glazer and the Norwegian Navy Band, which includes Friedrich Gulda&#8217;s entertainingly daft concerto.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here it is finally, my list of the best of what I found among 2012&#8217;s new releases. (I found a lot of great jazz from before I was born too, but that&#8217;s another story.) I no more listened to everything out there than anyone else did, but these are releases from 2012 that I listened to repeatedly and expect to be returning to in 2013 and beyond. The exact order is arbitrary and could change on any given day, though albums are probably roughly in the right quarter of the list. I&#8217;ve included at the end an honor roll of another 20 that did not quite make my list but were also greatly enjoyed. After all, I think the main function of lists like this is help folk find things (at least that&#8217;s how I use all the other lists out there).</p>

<strong>#1 Pjusk &#8211; <em>Tele</em></strong><br />
Norway&#8217;s Pjusk have become one my favorite ambient/electronic artists on the strength of three stellar releases. <em>Tele</em> (full review <a title="Review: Tele by Pjusk" href="http://musicisgood.org/2012/03/review-tele/" target="_blank">here</a>) takes us deep into the glacial cold of northern Norwegian landscapes &#8211; the tracks are themed around layers of rock and ice. Deep in the earth, we are taken on a dark and resonant atmospheric journey that ends in light and life. Creation is not all sunlit beaches, and this release gives us a masterful aural tour of its frozen recesses.<span id="more-3717"></span></p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-3790" alt="angelinthehouse" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-david-smith/angelinthehouse-150x150.jpg" width="110" height="110" /><br />
<strong>#2 Wil &amp; Tarl &#8211; <em>Angel in the House</em></strong><br />
This was the year I discovered Wil Bolton and fell in love with his work. My favorite two albums of his (<em>Chimes for a Wall Drawing</em> and <em>Time Lapse</em>) were not 2012 releases, but <em>Angel in the House</em>, a collaboration with Tarl Broad-Ashman on a limited <a title="Angel in the House" href="http://wilbolton.co.uk/2012/03/04/wil-tarl-angel-in-the-house/" target="_blank">3&#8243; CDR release</a>, is one of the best drone pieces I&#8217;ve ever heard. Deep, rich, and warm, with shifting surface textures, when I play it, it often ends up on repeat, which is more than I can say for most 19-minute tracks. One of those albums that feels like a permanent gift.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-3785" alt="Deupree 300x300" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-david-smith/Deupree-300x300-150x150.jpg" width="110" height="110" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-david-smith/Deupree-300x300-150x150.jpg 150w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-david-smith/Deupree-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 110px) 100vw, 110px" /><br />
<strong>#3 Taylor Deupree &#8211; <em>Faint</em></strong><br />
This album was the chief reason I could not compile this list in December; not only was it released in mid-December, but I had to wait until Christmas to unwrap the box set. Taylor Deupree has set very high standards both in his own work and in his curating of others&#8217; releases, and his <a href="http://www.12k.com/index.php/site/releases/faint/" target="_blank">latest</a> does not disappoint. Perhaps one of his most melodic releases, <em>Faint</em> hovers at the threshold of consciousness, immersing the listener in gently shifting pools of stillness.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-3788" alt="Talvihorros 300x300" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-david-smith/Talvihorros-300x300-150x150.jpg" width="110" height="110" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-david-smith/Talvihorros-300x300-150x150.jpg 150w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-david-smith/Talvihorros-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 110px) 100vw, 110px" /><br />
<strong>#4 Talvihorros &#8211; <em>And It Was So </em></strong><br />
How do you rank an album that you discovered less than a week ago and wonder if you are overrating just because it is new and wonderful but don&#8217;t want to underrate because it&#8217;s new and wonderful? Biblical in theme and grandeur, <a href="http://talvihorros.bandcamp.com/album/and-it-was-so" target="_blank" class="broken_link">this album</a> offers a series of expansive and dramatic sound-collage epics fusing guitar and electronics. In collaboration with their titles, the densely woven tracks evoke mysterious worlds emerging into being. An album to get lost in.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-3805" alt="Ishikaza" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-david-smith/Ishikaza-150x150.jpg" width="110" height="110" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-david-smith/Ishikaza-150x150.jpg 150w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-david-smith/Ishikaza.jpg 280w" sizes="(max-width: 110px) 100vw, 110px" /><br />
<strong>#5 Kimiko Ishizaka &#8211; <em>The Open Goldberg Variations</em></strong><br />
This deserves to be on more lists, not least because of what it represents. A kickstarter project was used to fund a top-quality new recording of Bach&#8217;s famous Goldberg Variations that could then be offered to the world <a title="Open Variations" href="http://www.opengoldbergvariations.org/" target="_blank">at no cost</a>, making one of the great classics of Western music available for free. There&#8217;s even an iPad app that can be used to follow along with the score. While the concept is admirable, the music is also beautiful, a crisp and delicate performance that keeps drawing me back for more.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-3792" alt="cello + laptop" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-david-smith/cello-+-laptop-150x150.jpg" width="110" height="110" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-david-smith/cello-+-laptop-150x150.jpg 150w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-david-smith/cello-+-laptop-300x300.jpg 300w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-david-smith/cello-+-laptop.jpg 350w" sizes="(max-width: 110px) 100vw, 110px" /><br />
<strong>#6 Cello + Laptop &#8211; <em>Parallel Paths</em></strong><br />
Last year I placed <em>Owl Splinters</em> by Deaf Center atop my list, and a year later still value it as highly. This <a href="http://envelopecollective.bandcamp.com/album/parallel-paths" target="_blank">release</a> from new Spanish duo Cello + Laptop has a similar aesthetic of haunting, distressed strings and darkly atmospheric passages. Gentle rhythms, crackles, chimes, and wistful lyrical snatches of melody make for a meditative listening experience. I&#8217;ll be looking out for more music from these folk.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-3789" alt="valta" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-david-smith/valta-150x150.jpg" width="110" height="110" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-david-smith/valta-150x150.jpg 150w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-david-smith/valta.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 110px) 100vw, 110px" /><br />
<strong>#7 Alamaailman Vasarat &#8211; <em>Valta</em></strong><br />
Finnish band Alamaailman Vasarat combine rock, jazz, klezmer, mediterranenan, and other influences into a wildly carnivalesque mix all of their own. Their latest release, Valta (full review <a title="Review: Valta by Alamaailman Vasarat" href="http://musicisgood.org/2012/07/review-valta-by-alamaailman-vasarat/" target="_blank">here</a>) is cohesive and compelling amid the mayhem, and above all great fun. Probably the only album this year to use the sound of red wine dripping from a four-meter tower to establish tempo.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-3811" alt="loscil0_" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-david-smith/loscil0_1-150x150.jpg" width="110" height="110" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-david-smith/loscil0_1-150x150.jpg 150w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-david-smith/loscil0_1.jpg 280w" sizes="(max-width: 110px) 100vw, 110px" /><br />
<strong>#8 Loscil &#8211;<em> Sketches from New Brighton</em></strong><br />
I have loved pretty much everything loscil has put out. This <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sketches-from-New-Brighton/dp/B00945E4WM/ref=sr_shvl_album_1?ie=UTF8&#038;qid=1358009721&#038;sr=301-1" target="_blank" class="broken_link">latest release</a> continues his immediately recognizable sound and is tied thematically to previous albums. The warmly enveloping atmospheres, the gently hypnotic rhythms that insinuate their way into your subconscious, the subtle layers and patterns are all in place. A few new rhythmical twists and a slightly darker edge here and there keep things moving forward. Very enjoyable as ever.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-3810" alt="Fischer and Deupree300x300" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-david-smith/Fischer-and-Deupree300x300-150x150.jpg" width="110" height="110" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-david-smith/Fischer-and-Deupree300x300-150x150.jpg 150w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-david-smith/Fischer-and-Deupree300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 110px) 100vw, 110px" /><br />
<strong>#9 Taylor Deupree + Marcus Fischer &#8211; <em> In A Place Of Such Graceful Shapes </em></strong><br />
Taylor Deupree and Marcus Fischer have separately both made albums that I cherish; together early in 2012 they added a joint slice of beauty. At the heart of the <a href="http://www.12k.com/index.php/site/releases/in_a_place_of_such_graceful_shapes/" target="_blank" class="broken_link">album</a> is a 50 minute expanse of gentle stasis filled with subtle shifts of tone, rustlings of small objects, and sounds evocative of small events carried on the air in some undisturbed wintry outdoors. Meticulous in its attention to detail and absorbing in its microscopic movement.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-3826" alt="Ikin300x300" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-david-smith/Ikin300x300-150x150.jpg" width="110" height="110" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-david-smith/Ikin300x300-150x150.jpg 150w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-david-smith/Ikin300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 110px) 100vw, 110px" /><br />
<strong>#10 Kane Ikin &#8211; <em>Sublunar</em></strong><br />
Kane Ikin&#8217;s first full-length (full review <a title="Review: Sublunar by Kane Ikin" href="http://musicisgood.org/2012/11/review-sublunar-by-kane-ikin/" target="_blank">here</a>) offers up a thought-provoking marriage of cosmic distances and grainy, nostalgic sounds recovered from the past. Hazy static and lurching rhythms leave a sense of listening to distant landscapes through a grainy, earthy musical language rooted right here. Sometimes pulsing, sometimes creaking and rumbling, the tracks vary from dark to whimsical. A distinctive and absorbing release.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-3812" alt="Woven Tide300x300" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-david-smith/Woven-Tide300x300-150x150.jpg" width="110" height="110" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-david-smith/Woven-Tide300x300-150x150.jpg 150w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-david-smith/Woven-Tide300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 110px) 100vw, 110px" /><br />
<strong>#11 From the Mouth of the Sun &#8211; <em>Woven Tide</em></strong><br />
One of the year&#8217;s first releases, this album remains one if its strongest. Featuring the collaborative work of Aaron Martin and Dag Rosenqvist, it combines haunting orchestration, noise/drone elements, and a variety of acoustic instruments into a whole that is now mournful, now lyrical. Subtle drama arises from the interplay of the layers. (Full review <a title="Review: Woven Tide by From the Mouth of the Sun" href="http://musicisgood.org/2012/01/review-woven-tide/" target="_blank">here</a>).</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-3818" alt="Orcas300x300" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-david-smith/Orcas300x300-150x150.jpg" width="110" height="110" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-david-smith/Orcas300x300-150x150.jpg 150w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-david-smith/Orcas300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 110px) 100vw, 110px" /><br />
<strong>#12 Orcas &#8211; <em>Orcas</em></strong><br />
This is another collaboration, this time between Benoît Pioulard and Rafael Anton Irisarri. One could also think of it as a kind of collaboration between ambient, folk and pop musical motifs. The <a href="http://www.emusic.com/listen/#/album/rafael-anton-irisarri/orcas/13102049/:" target="_blank">songs</a> have a kind of sleepwalking melancholy, moving sedately through dreamy-yet-detailed collages of acoustic and electronic instrumentation. The overall effect is soothing, melodic, and appealing.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-3817" alt="Hidden Orchestra300x300" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-david-smith/Hidden-Orchestra300x300-150x150.jpg" width="110" height="110" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-david-smith/Hidden-Orchestra300x300-150x150.jpg 150w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-david-smith/Hidden-Orchestra300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 110px) 100vw, 110px" /><br />
<strong>#13 Hidden Orchestra &#8211; <em>Archipelago</em></strong><br />
Hidden orchestra have quickly managed to establish a unique and recognizable sound that combines elements of jazz, hip hop, electronic and classical music into a vibrant and organic instrumental whole. Their <a href="http://www.emusic.com/album/hidden-orchestra/archipelago/13605271/" target="_blank">new album</a> continues very much where the previous one left off, with plaintive melodies wed to invigorating rhythms and a sweeping, windswept sense of breadth. Excellent listening.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-3816" alt="Harris_" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-david-smith/Harris_-150x150.jpg" width="110" height="110" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-david-smith/Harris_-150x150.jpg 150w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-david-smith/Harris_.jpg 280w" sizes="(max-width: 110px) 100vw, 110px" /><br />
<strong>#14 Mark Harris &#8211; <em>An Idea of North / Learning to Walk</em></strong><br />
Beginning almost imperceptibly with the sound of rain and birdsong, ambient electronic textures seem to emerge seamlessly from the natural environment. <a href="http://www.emusic.com/album/mark-harris/an-idea-of-north-learning-to-walk/13793447/" target="_blank">The album</a> offers a single 45 minute soundscape that is marked by gentle restraint and disciplined serenity, with not a sound out of place. Very much worth slowing down for.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-3814" alt="Egyptology300x300" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-david-smith/Egyptology300x300-150x150.jpg" width="110" height="110" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-david-smith/Egyptology300x300-150x150.jpg 150w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-david-smith/Egyptology300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 110px) 100vw, 110px" /><br />
<strong>#15 Egyptology &#8211; <em>The Skies</em></strong></p>
<p>This album was a bit of a bolt from the blue. Unashamedly retro, it takes the familiar science fiction tropes of classic analog synth music and celebrates them unabashedly, injecting in the process an infectious freshness and energy. Alternating playfulness and majesty, <a href="http://clappingmusic.bandcamp.com/album/the-skies" target="_blank">this album</a> is a delight throughout.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-3821" alt="Dwindlers" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-david-smith/Dwindlers-150x150.jpg" width="110" height="110" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-david-smith/Dwindlers-150x150.jpg 150w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-david-smith/Dwindlers-300x300.jpg 300w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-david-smith/Dwindlers.jpg 350w" sizes="(max-width: 110px) 100vw, 110px" /><br />
<strong>#16 The Dwindlers &#8211; <em>Allegories</em></strong><br />
I&#8217;ve admired Benjamin Dauer&#8217;s ambient work; his releases as half of The Dwindlers head in a <a href="http://heartandsoulpublisher.bandcamp.com/album/allegories" target="_blank">different direction</a>. The warm, dusky voice of Michele Seaman reads quirky, thoughtful poetry over a musical backdrop of spare, ambling bass and percussion, creating an intimate, jazzy vibe. Very enjoyable, and one of many reasons to be sad that the Heart and Soul label has not survived into 2013.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-3820" alt="Bolton300x300" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-david-smith/Bolton300x300-150x150.jpg" width="110" height="110" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-david-smith/Bolton300x300-150x150.jpg 150w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-david-smith/Bolton300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 110px) 100vw, 110px" /><br />
<strong>#17 Wil Bolton &#8211; <em>Under a Name That Hides Her</em></strong><br />
I mentioned above my new found love for Wil Bolton&#8217;s music. He had a prolific year in 2012. This full-length <a href="http://hibernaterecordings.bandcamp.com/album/under-a-name-that-hides-her" target="_blank" class="broken_link">release</a> shares some of the absorbing qualities of his excellent <em>Time Lapse</em>. Bright chiming textures, treated guitar and restrained field recordings of natural sounds combine to create an aural journey filled with light and space.</p>

<strong>#18 Good Weather for an Airstrike &#8211; <em>Underneath the Stars</em></strong><br />
An ambient concept album themed around the phases of sleep may more than flirt with cliché, but Tom Honey&#8217;s full length release succeeds at creating something that both subliminally drifts and retains an overall narrative shape. The best tracks are as delicate and beautiful as anything I&#8217;ve heard this year, and the album holds up to repeated listens. A soothing and thoughtful contribution to this year&#8217;s music. (Full review <a title="Review: Underneath the Stars by Good Weather for an Airstrike" href="http://musicisgood.org/2012/01/review-underneath-the-stars/">here</a>).</p>

<strong>#19 Aidan &amp; Richard Baker &#8211; <em>Variations On A Loop (Rhythms)</em></strong><br />
This one is unlikely to be everyone&#8217;s cup of tea. Two long tracks each endlessly loop a brief segment of drums, bass, and off-kilter guitar, subjecting it to gradual variation, distortion, and decay. The result is oddly compelling. The loop has a hypnotic quality, and the subtle changes offer a shifting array of textures and details, subtly modulating the mood as each piece progresses.  Best for close listening.</p>

<strong>#20 Ian Boddy &#8211; <em>Strange Attractors</em></strong><br />
Ian Boddy, curator of the DiN label, has over the years put out a steady stream of Berlin school analog synthesizer music, full of burbling, pulsating sequences and drifting alien soundscapes. I find that some of his releases grab me much more than others; <em>Strange Attractors</em> proved strangely attractive. 75 minutes of glorious space music. (Review <a title="Three Analog Delights" href="http://musicisgood.org/2012/08/three-analog-delights/">here</a>)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s the time of year when folks post their &#8220;Best of&#8221; lists, and MiG is no exception.  So without further ado, here are the Top 20 albums (and some others that deserve recognition) according to Craig McManus:</p>
<p><strong>Top 20</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/concert-review-dirty-projectors-and-purity-ring-at-first-avenue/Purity-Ring.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-3381 alignleft" alt="Purity Ring" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/concert-review-dirty-projectors-and-purity-ring-at-first-avenue/Purity-Ring.jpg" width="180" height="180" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/concert-review-dirty-projectors-and-purity-ring-at-first-avenue/Purity-Ring.jpg 300w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/concert-review-dirty-projectors-and-purity-ring-at-first-avenue/Purity-Ring-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 180px) 100vw, 180px" /></a>1. Purity Ring – <em>Shrines</em>: 2011 introduced us to Purity Ring through the singles “Ungirthed”, “Lofticries”, and “Belispeak”, and each of these songs could have made my best of list. Accordingly, I was highly anticipating the release of the band’s debut full length. When news broke that each of these songs would be included on <em>Shrines</em>, however, I grew concerned that Purity Ring didn’t have the depth of quality for a full LP. Obviously, <em>Shrines</em>’ placement on this list demonstrates that my concern was unfounded. With tracks like “Obedear”, “Fineshrine”, and “Crawlersout” added to the early singles, Purity Ring created a dark synth pop gem. The only real negative to the album is the inclusion of the frankly dreadful, “Grandloves”.<span id="more-3666"></span><br />
<a href="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-craig-mcmanus/51-AVZnNsRL._SL500_AA280_.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-3675 alignleft" alt="The Men" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-craig-mcmanus/51-AVZnNsRL._SL500_AA280_.jpg" width="168" height="168" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-craig-mcmanus/51-AVZnNsRL._SL500_AA280_.jpg 280w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-craig-mcmanus/51-AVZnNsRL._SL500_AA280_-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 168px) 100vw, 168px" /></a>2. The Men – <em>Open Your Heart</em>: I’m incredibly hesitant to even make the comparison, but The Men remind me strongly of Hüsker Dü. Both bands came on the scene with a burst of noise rock, but the early material of each demonstrated true pop sensibilities. Over the years, Hüsker Dü allowed more of those sensibilities to emerge, and with <em>Open Your Heart</em>, The Men are following the same script. The album opens with tracks reminiscent of <em>Leave Home</em> and the band’s earlier work, but those soon give way to pop hooks and even an experiment with alt country. The experiment is the album’s lone misstep, but even as a failure it further proves that The Men are going to take chances even at the risk of alienating their audience, and that’s a Hüsker Dü move if ever there was one.<br />

Frank Ocean – <em>Channel Orange</em>: So much ink has already been used on <em>Channel Orange</em>, I’m not sure there is any ground left to cover. From Ocean’s preemptive announcement regarding his first love, and the importance of such a confession from a hip hop/r&amp;b star; to the release of the phenomenal “Pyramids”; and finally to the release of the album itself, Ocean has shown he not only can write a massively enjoyable and critically acclaimed album, but that he can play the fame game as well. The last few weeks have begun to see a bit of backlash against the album, but with tracks like “Thinkin Bout You”, “Sweet Life”, “Pyramids”, “Lost”, and especially “Bad Religion”, <em>Channel Orange</em> has earned its place in the canon and isn’t going anywhere.<br />

Dirty Projectors – <em>Swing Lo Magellan</em>: <em>Bitte Orca</em> was my favorite album of 2009 and I still love to listen to it today. That said, even I can admit it gets awfully pretentious at times. On <em>Swing Lo Magellan</em>, David Longstreth does an excellent job of toning down the pretension by reigning in his vocal yips, writing more straight pop hooks, and even poking some fun at himself on “Unto Caesar” by leaving in Amber Coffman’s teasing studio chatter. In doing so, Longstreth allows the band’s best attributes to shine through. The gorgeous harmonies of Coffman and co., syncopated beats, and use of space are given room to breathe and create a wonderful album of weird indie pop.<br />
<a href="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-craig-mcmanus/61PdQ8tWBGL._SL500_AA280_.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-3684 alignleft" alt="Beach House" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-craig-mcmanus/61PdQ8tWBGL._SL500_AA280_.jpg" width="168" height="168" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-craig-mcmanus/61PdQ8tWBGL._SL500_AA280_.jpg 280w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-craig-mcmanus/61PdQ8tWBGL._SL500_AA280_-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 168px) 100vw, 168px" /></a>5. Beach House &#8211; <em>Bloom</em>: Beach House is a band that knows who they are and does not mess with the formula. Fortunately for them, that formula of shoegazey dream pop is an absolute winner. Before even pressing play on my first listen to <em>Bloom</em> I knew exactly what it would sound like, but that fact didn’t make it any less captivating. The superb “Myth” sets the mood much as “Zebra” did for 2010’s <em>Teen Dream</em>, and what follows is an hour’s worth of lush, contemplative, layered pop, highlighted by “Wild”, “Lazuli”, and “New Year”, that is perfect for both lying in the park on a sunny day or huddling inside while the snow flies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-craig-mcmanus/51xYOhoP0RL._SL500_AA280_.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-3679 alignleft" alt="Japandroids" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-craig-mcmanus/51xYOhoP0RL._SL500_AA280_.jpg" width="168" height="168" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-craig-mcmanus/51xYOhoP0RL._SL500_AA280_.jpg 280w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-craig-mcmanus/51xYOhoP0RL._SL500_AA280_-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 168px) 100vw, 168px" /></a>6. Japandroids – <em>Celebration Rock</em>: The fact that two guys from Vancouver can make a racket as fantastic as that found on <em>Celebration Rock</em> is remarkable. The fact they can do it while admitting to hating the recording process, and only doing it so they can continue touring, is mind blowing. <em>Celebration Rock</em> starts strong with “The Nights of Wine and Roses” and doesn’t let up until reaching a massive crescendo with the album’s closing two tracks. Those two tracks, “The House that Heaven Built” and “Continuous Thunder”, are without doubt the best one, two punch released this year, and cap off a truly great album in the way it deserves.<br />
<a href="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-craig-mcmanus/41y+RxoUkpL._SL500_AA280_.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-3674 alignleft" alt="Cloud Nothings" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-craig-mcmanus/41y+RxoUkpL._SL500_AA280_.jpg" width="168" height="168" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-craig-mcmanus/41y+RxoUkpL._SL500_AA280_.jpg 280w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-craig-mcmanus/41y+RxoUkpL._SL500_AA280_-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 168px) 100vw, 168px" /></a>7. Cloud Nothings – <em>Attack on Memory</em>: Cloud Nothings started as the solo bedroom project of Dylan Baldi that fit in well with all the lo-fi indie pop coming out in 2009-2010. So it came as a bit of a surprise to hear that the now four-piece band was recording an album with Steve Albini. Turns out, the band knew what they were doing. While Baldi’s earlier work had a bit of a punk feel there was still a sweetness to his songs. With <em>Attack on Memory</em>, however, the band has fully abandoned that sweetness for a sharper, noisier, and most of all harder sound. In fact, I’ve seen <em>Attack on Memory</em> described as “post-hardcore”, and while I’ve never liked that particular genre tag, I can certainly hear post-hardcore kings Fugazi all over <em>Attack on Memory</em>.<br />
<a href="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-craig-mcmanus/51yNumngihL._SL500_AA280_.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-3681 alignleft" alt="Killer Mike" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-craig-mcmanus/51yNumngihL._SL500_AA280_.jpg" width="168" height="168" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-craig-mcmanus/51yNumngihL._SL500_AA280_.jpg 280w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-craig-mcmanus/51yNumngihL._SL500_AA280_-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 168px) 100vw, 168px" /></a>8. Killer Mike – <em>R.A.P. Music</em>: It seems like Killer Mike has been around forever. He made his debut in 2000 on Outkast’s <em>Stankonia</em>, and has been a fixture of the ATL hip hop scene ever since. His southern growl has brought his particular brand of political rap (attacking politics as a whole, while making sure to share his venom in a bipartisan manner) to solo work, guest appearances, and even television and movies. Somehow, though, he’s never quite had a breakthrough album until <em>R.A.P. Music</em>. With <em>R.A.P. Music</em>, however, he has released an absolute classic of political hip hop, highlighted by “Anywhere But Here” and “Reagan”, and finally broken through to a truly national audience.<br />

Poliça – <em>Give You the Ghost</em>: I previously discussed Poliça in <a href="http://musicisgood.org/2012/01/dispatches-from-funkytown-3-the-next-generation/">Dispatches from Funkytown #3</a>, but <em>Give You the Ghost</em> has been released since that time, and it lived up to the hype. The band’s dark synth pop, supported by two drum kits, is at the same time both alluring and somewhat disturbing, and while the autotune on Channy Leaneagh’s vocals can come on strong, its use is understandable in the context of the band. In fact, the album is so impressive the band was signed to, and <em>Give You the Ghost</em> rereleased by, the highly respected indie label Mom &amp; Pop this summer. If you haven’t yet had the opportunity to listen to the album, do so now.<br />

Kendrick Lamar – <em>good kid, m.A.A.d. city</em>: <em>good kid, m.A.A.d. city</em> is an album that has already been dissected ad nauseum, has rightfully topped countless year end lists, and likely is the instant classic those lists claim. There’s nothing for me to add to what others have said.</p>

Brother Ali – <em>Mourning in America and Dreaming in Color</em>: It’s unfortunate that Brother Ali does his best work when life is at its hardest, but with <em>Mourning in America</em> he has certainly turned his pain into our gain.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://musicisgood.org/2012/01/dispatches-from-funkytown-4-the-currents-7th-birthday-party/the-current/" rel="attachment wp-att-1941"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1941" title="The Current" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/The-Current.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="279" /></a>On January 24, 2005, Minnesota Public Radio launched 89.3 The Current with the playing of Atmosphere’s hidden track off the <em>Seven’s Travels</em> album, “Shhh”.  “Shhh” is an ode to Minnesota and being proud of where you’re from regardless of what others think of your hometown.  It was an incredibly appropriate first track to air on a station who’s <a href="http://minnesota.publicradio.org/radio/services/the_current/about/">mission</a> is to bring its listeners the best new local and national music alongside the music that inspired it.<span id="more-1939"></span></p>
<iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/bV_E8SPc_jo?version=3&amp;wmode=transparent" width="560" height="340" title="YouTube video player" style="background-color:#000;display:block;margin-bottom:0;max-width:100%;" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="font-size:11px;margin-top:0;"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV_E8SPc_jo" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube">Watch this video on YouTube</a>.</p>
<p>Since that day The Current has held true to its desire to spotlight Minnesota artists through a great number of areas: The Current plays at least two local tracks per hour (usually substantially more); the station presents countless concerts and in-studio performances by local bands, airs a weekly <a href="http://minnesota.publicradio.org/radio/programs/local_show/">‘Local Show’</a>; a local band plays each year at the <a href="http://minnesota.publicradio.org/radio/services/the_current/rock-the-garden/">Rock the Garden</a> festival; a 24-hour <a href="http://minnesota.publicradio.org/radio/services/the_current/local/">‘Local Current’ stream</a> was launched in 2011; a <a href="http://blog.thecurrent.org/">‘Local Current’ blog</a> was recently created; two volumes of “Local Current” mixtapes comprised of in-studio performances have now been released; and starting with the station&#8217;s 5th birthday a party has been held at First Avenue featuring all local acts.</p>
<p>This year’s 7th Current Birthday Party was the first to be spread over two nights (January 27 and 28) and featured the expected eclectic mix of artists.  The 27th featured Night Moves, Low, Dead Man Winter, and Tapes ‘n Tapes, with the 28th presenting Haley Bonar, Sims, Suicide Commandos, and Poliça.  Due in large part to The Current&#8217;s strong support of the local music scene, both shows sold out within about 15 minutes of going on sale.  This despite the fact that they were initially only available for purchase by MPR members.  Unfortunately, real life got in the way for a few minutes and kept me away from the computer at the moment tickets went on sale and I was shut out of the Saturday show.  Friday tickets lasted a few minutes longer, though, and I was able to grab two tickets to that show.</p>
<p>The concert opened with a performance by <strong>Night Moves</strong> (discussed in <a href="/2012/01/dispatches-from-funkytown-3-the-next-generation/">‘Dispatches from Funkytown #3’</a>), and it is clear from this performance why Domino was willing to sign them despite their having never ‘sold’ an album.  Musically the group was remarkably tight for being such a young band, and, after what sounded from where I stood like a vocal imbalance during the opening song, didn’t seem to have any issues playing a larger club venue.</p>
<p>The crowd was not as into the music as I might have expected, but I chalk that up to Night Moves being the first band of the evening and the fact that very few people were able to download the album in the brief time it was available.  The Current has been playing two songs off the album, but a majority of the crowd were hearing almost all of the songs for the first time.  The band closed, as expected, with “Horses” (one of the tracks still available on Bandcamp) and it lived up to its status as the best track on the album, but I was particularly impressed with “Colored Emotions” the album’s ‘title track’ that actually ended up not being on the prior release of the album.  According to the band they expect it to be on the reissue from Domino this summer, and as good as the rest of the album is, &#8220;Colored Emotions&#8221; has single written all over it.</p>
<p>The only negative to the performance was some uncomfortable crowd interaction.  As surprising as it was to see a young band as musically ready to play a show like this, it was equally unsurprising that they don’t quite have their stage presence down yet.  Guitarist/lead singer John Pelant attempted to engage the crowd, but it was clear he didn’t quite know what he was doing and was very uncomfortable with it.  Bassist Micky Alfano appeared a little more comfortable with this aspect of the live show, but whether he was talking too quietly or his mic was simply too low it was nearly impossible to figure out what he was actually saying.</p>
<p>In the end, though, it’s all about the music and Night Moves will have plenty of time to work on the rest of the show.  Accordingly, they receive a <strong>B</strong> grade from me on the night.</p>
<p>Up second was <strong>Low</strong>, a band I was shocked wasn’t given the closing slot.  After seeing the full bill, though, I think there were three reasons they went when they did: 1) The band’s percussion set up allowed Dead Man Winter’s drum kit to be in place early and sped up the set changes; 2) The fact that this wasn’t billed as a Low headlining show meant that their ‘slowcore’ may not have played well as the last act; and 3) the ‘surprise’ end of Tapes ‘n Tapes’ set would not have worked with Low&#8217;s drum kit (more on the surprise in a moment).</p>
<p>As for the show itself, it is clear that Low has been doing this for awhile and they know <em>exactly</em> what they are doing on stage.  I was very concerned during the opening song that I wouldn’t be able to enjoy the set because a lot of the crowd was being terribly disrespectful to the band and talking over the music.  When they moved into their second song, “Try to Sleep”, however, those concerns were put to rest.  Low had obviously experienced this issue before and didn&#8217;t let it affect the performance at all.  Most of the rest of the set had enough volume that the talking was drowned out somewhat, the one exception to this being a fantastic rendition of &#8220;Murderer&#8221; which had me seething at much of the audience.  More important than the volume, though, was that I became absolutely mesmerized by the band.  “Especially Me” and “Nothing But Heart” in particular were utterly gorgeous and left me with no doubt as to who was the best band of the night.  Honestly, the only thing keeping Low from a very rare A+ from me is the fact they were limited to 45 minutes.  I wanted nothing more than to pull up a chair with no one else around and listen to them for hours.  Accordingly, Low receives an <strong>A</strong>.</p>
<p>The third act of the night is difficult for me to review fully.  <strong>Dead Man Winter</strong> is a side project of several members of Trampled By Turtles, but leans much more country than the bluegrass of the Turtles and I don’t listen to much country.  Too much current country music simply sounds like bad pop with a twang to me, so when I do listen to the genre it tends to be older Johnny Cash type music.  Dead Man Winter, though, does not sound much like either of these country styles, so my musical knowledge base is rather weak (if MiG authors Kezzie Baker or Bad Thoughts had seen the show I’m certain they’d be able to wax poetic about the music itself).</p>
<p>With that disclaimer, however, the show itself was simply average.  It’s clear even without knowing the technical ability that goes into playing with Trampled By Turtles, that the band’s musicianship is unquestionable.  It was equally clear that these guys are professional performers and have earned their spot on the stage.  The problem was that I didn’t feel any passion from the performance except when the crowd got into it during a cover of the Turtles’ track “Victory”.  This was clearly not a crowd that usually attends Dead Man Winter shows, or even listens to their music with regularity, so most of the performance was fairly flat.  When they started playing “Victory”, though, the immediate crowd excitement clearly had an effect on the band and we got to see what I assume is the real Dead Man Winter live show (this occurred again to a lesser extent when the band closed with “Nicotine” which The Current has been playing recently).</p>
<p>The glimpse I did get of what is obviously a talented band is causing me to seek out Dead Man Winter’s album <em>Bright Lights</em>, but this particular performance gets a <strong>C</strong> rating.</p>
<p>The show was closed by <strong>Tapes ‘n Tapes</strong>, a band cursed with the mixed blessing of being an early blogosphere favorite.  Thanks to the buzz surrounding their 2006 debut, <em>The Loon</em>, and the negative reviews of it’s follow up, the band was one of the first to experience the rapid rise and fall now common in the internet age.  Based on this performance, however, the group has not only survived this rollercoaster, but has come through with flying colors.</p>
<p>If Night Moves appeared to lack some stage presence and seem uncomfortable from time to time, Tapes ‘n Tapes commanded every inch of the stage.  From the opening instrumental through “Insister”, which closed their set proper, they blasted from track to track and had much of the crowd dancing (or at least bobbing) along.  Plus, they pulled out some brass instrumentation a couple times, for which I am an absolute and unrepentant sucker.  It was a tight and very good performance that proved the decision to close with the band was the right one.</p>
<p>As previously noted, the need to have Tapes ‘n Tapes close the show was also demonstrated by the surprise ending.  The Current is making it a tradition to close its birthday shows with a group sing, and this year Tapes ‘n Tapes frontman Josh Grier led a surprisingly passable cover of “Purple Rain” (YouTube of a portion of the song is below).  Joined on guitar by Low’s Alan Sparhawk the band came much closer to pulling off such a brilliantly technical song than I ever would have guessed, and my hat is off to them.</p>
<p>On the whole Tapes ‘n Tapes gets a <strong>B+</strong> and I advise everyone to go see them when they come to town.  They may not have lived up to the blogs’ hopes in 2005-2006, but they are a darn good band.</p>

<p><em><a title="FareWell Poetry" href="http://www.farewell-poetry.com/releases.html">Hoping for the Invisible to Ignite</a></em> by Parisian collective FareWell Poetry is one of the more absorbing musical journeys of 2011. It is also an album that wears its ambition on its sleeve. A Super 8/16mm black and white film on DVD (trailer <a title="Vimeo" href="http://vimeo.com/24995247" target="_blank">here</a>), filled with images of compulsive self-absorption and erotic obsession (warning: nudity), accompanies the 20 minute opening piece, and there&#8217;s also an <a title="iTunes" href="http://itunes.apple.com/app/farewell-poetry-as-true-as/id466413875?mt=8" target="_blank">iPhone app</a> to go alongside both. The lyrics take the form of extravagant spoken-word poetry boasting a lofty lineage:</p>
<blockquote><p>‘As True As Troilus’ takes its title and mythology from Chaucer’s important 14th century poem ‘Troilus and Criseyde’, a retelling of a ‘faux’ Greek myth with Medieval origins, in which the main protagonist Troilus falls in love with Trojan Cressida who finally deceives and leaves him for the Greek soldier Diomedes. The narrator of ‘As True As Troilus’ (just as Chaucer’s narrator) uses this myth to explore his own romantic mythology, using the characters and their situation to recount his own plight, illustrating the destruction of his own failed relationship with tableaux from the Trojan tale.</p></blockquote>
<p>Act 3, Scene 2 of Shakespeare&#8217;s <em>Troilus and Cressida</em>, which portrays the same doomed love affair, also plays a role, and Ovid is cited in the film. Described on the band&#8217;s site as a &#8220;bold and electrifying project,&#8221; we are left in no doubt that this is a work of substance.</p>
<p><span id="more-1213"></span>This much ambition can backfire, and there were on first listen moments when I was left feeling that the earnest cadences were trying a little too hard to assure me that I was listening to Very Deep And Important Poetry. However, the readings grow in power with subsequent listens. Allow yourself to be drawn in and a compelling musical journey awaits. You can stream the album below as you read, courtesy of the band&#8217;s <a title="FareWell Poetry" href="http://www.farewell-poetry.com/" target="_blank">webpage</a>.</p>
<p><iframe src="http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fplaylists%2F1340150&amp;auto_play=false&amp;show_artwork=false&amp;color=000000" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" width="100%" height="340"></iframe></p>
<p>The dominant style is a kind of avant-garde, minimalist post-rock with ambient touches. Add FareWell Poetry to bands such as Kwoon and MØN and it seems as if a chunk of the most interesting post-rock is coming from Paris these days. There are clear affinities with the compositions of Godspeed You! Black Emperor. One thing that set the best GYBE epics apart from the rest of the post-rock fold was the sense of storytelling, a sense created not just from the long arcs of build and release central to the genre, but from the field recordings and spoken word passages that anchored the sweeping sonic landscapes in personal biographies and glimpses of human hopes and fears. These fragile fragments of sonic portraiture were in turn elevated to a widescreen treatment by the expansive instrumental journeys that accompanied them. FareWell Poetry&#8217;s debut release comes closer than anything else I&#8217;ve heard to both carrying forward what was exciting about those GYBE stories-in-sound and adding its own distinctive contribution.</p>
<p>GYBE&#8217;s political edge is absent here; the emphasis is more psychological, even psychoanalytic. The opening track, &#8216;As True as Troilus&#8217;, opens with 14 minutes of emotionally estranged poetic narrative, written and performed by poet/filmmaker Jayne Amara Ross. It is accompanied by a slow, tense burn of guitar groans and ambient sounds. Perhaps referencing the appeal that Shakespeare&#8217;s Troilus makes to conventional lovers&#8217; similes (&#8220;rhymes,/Full of protest, of oath and big compare&#8221;) before parading &#8220;true as Troilus&#8221; as the new standard of faithfulness, the track opens with its own lurid web of similes. They trace the anguish of a passion betrayed by both the other&#8217;s unfaithfulness and one&#8217;s own willing self-deception. The narrator&#8217;s lover has left, and dogged faithfulness turns cold and despairing, &#8220;dwarfed in not knowing why&#8221;. Former hopes now &#8220;suck at my bowels, like mice&#8221;. Dreams of things being different quickly circle back to the inauspicious beginnings of the relationship, its beginnings suggesting both love and possession, both desire and denial. The narrator speaks wistfully of being &#8220;in dreams airlifted out&#8221;, yet the film shows only racing fingers compulsively knotting a fragile rope ladder out of string and matches. As the emotional furies swirl, the music continues to build, and the emerging melody, after tense ebbs and flows, finally erupts in a powerful guitar-led maelstrom.</p>
<p>The second and third tracks are parts 1 and 2 of a second epic, titled &#8216;All in the Full, Indomitable Light of Hope.&#8217; There is little hope to be found in the first part. Barely audible ambient drones and creaking strings create a bleak, windswept effect that drifts into sad melody. The narrator returns in more pensive mode &#8211; the initial storm is exhausted, &#8220;life finds its way back to me,&#8221; and the possibility of hope is painfully raised. Part 2 risks evoking the lazy reviewer comment that &#8220;it&#8217;s been done before by [insert name of post-rock band]&#8221; (ironically itself a tired cliché). It opens with melodious guitar and gentle chimes, then proceeds through gently repeating figures into tremolo passages as percussion builds, and the song climaxes in a glorious swell of hope. The structure is indeed familiar (though gorgeously done), but the interesting thing is not whether we have heard these sounds before, but rather what is being done with them <em>here</em>.</p>
<p>As the guitars die away into more dissonant feedback and scraping strings, the narrator returns with a complex determination, more elegiac than triumphant, to &#8220;dance the old dance in new footwear.&#8221; With hope, however, so also &#8220;darkness finds its way back to me.&#8221; It&#8217;s as if the narrator wishes that life were a conventionally ascending post-rock triumph, but needs to keep hope honest. It is telling that here the spoken word is kept separate from the melodic sections, tied to the bleaker opening and conclusion, as if self and hope are still in conversation. The sweet, soaring hope of the guitars is now more complex, real (&#8220;But I have love!&#8221;), yet precarious. This pair of tracks ends with the couplet &#8220;And there is no one time too many,/And there are no redundant prayers&#8221;. In what is to my ear one of the most effective vocal moments on the album, a modulation of the voice on the final word reframes these lines with a fragile, questioning note, as if saying &#8220;there are no redundant prayers&#8230;are there? Please tell me there aren&#8217;t?&#8221;</p>
<p>The final track, brief but poignant, draws the threads together. The title, &#8216;In Dreams Airlifted Out&#8217;, picks up a line from the earlier lyric, and the melody also is drawn from &#8216;True as Troilus&#8217;. In the first track the narrator had wished &#8220;to be a pianist/and hunger at the keys,&#8221; to &#8220;hammer out my own truth, weave a sharp confession, my knuckles chiming over the launch pad like church bells.&#8221; This closing track opens with a church bell &#8211; not celebratory, but solemnly chiming the hour. The melody appears at first in the naively chiming notes of a music box (hope!), before being picked up by an out-of-tune piano. After a few bars, a floating electronic interlude shifts us to an ethereal dream world, then the piano melody returns, moving into a higher register, but with an accompanying dark, low rumble.</p>
<p>The album thus ends on a marvelously nuanced note, a chastened, cracked, but sweet and real hope still in conversation with pain and despair, struggling to flower out of hurt, still seeking a foundation that might ground the continuing possibility of love. It is a fitting conclusion to a narrative that has wrestled so elementally with whether faithfulness can salvage denial, whether hope can survive betrayal, whether confession can heal, whether prayers are still meaningful, whether there is a way beyond the string-and-matches ladder of one passion tied in series to the next. The album is far more honest than most pop music about the price of careless eros, and as a result the tenuously determined thread of hope reaches for something more than glib optimism.</p>
<p>This review is already long enough to test patience, though there is much more that could be said &#8211; all of it, like the above, just my interpretation of the work. Suffice it to say that this is an important album, indeed a &#8220;bold and electrifying project.&#8221; In terms of emotional and lyrical complexity, this is streets ahead of most other post-rock releases, and the music is carefully and effectively married to the poetry, demanding serious attention and rewarding with articulate depth. Listen with care.</p>

<p>My compatriots have done an excellent job highlighting music that restores the seriousness of Christmas. As a Jew (a Reconstructionist, the lit-crit version of Judaism), I don&#8217;t feel like I have a stake in this game. Outside of a few songs, there aren&#8217;t any great Hanukkah albums. My holiday music tends be Klezmer, which can be played any time of the year.</p>
<p>There are a handful of Christmas songs I do enjoy. Wassails and winter songs aren&#8217;t necessarily Christmas songs: they are seasonal, coinciding with the Holidays. Indeed, &#8220;Jingle Bells&#8221; was written for Thanksgiving. There are carols that are based on excellent folk tunes that can get me moving (I will play “We Three Kings” and “It Came Upon A Midnight Clear” as jigs). What tends to bother me about some Christmas songs is the repeated use of the same chord progressions, composed of I-ii-Vs and IV-iii-ii-I turnarounds (see &#8220;Jingle Bell Rock&#8221;, &#8220;Frosty the Snowman&#8221;, and &#8220;Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer&#8221;). Popular Christmas tunes tend to sound alike, which in my opinion reflects the composers&#8217; laziness.</p>
<p>Among my favorite Christmas songs is The Pogues&#8217; “Fairytale of New York,” which could either be seen as deep and dark or over-the-top, the alternative version of <em>It&#8217;s a Wonderful Life </em>or the Christmas version of &#8220;Bohemian Rhapsody&#8221;. From the production standpoint, the song is impeccable: soaring strings, perfectly timed transitions, even a big dropout to give power to “the bells were ringing out on Christmas day.” From a more cynical standpoint, the song is a crass attempt at a big commercial hit: the duet with Kirsty MacColl could be construed to be a gimmick, and the New York theme and the stadium sound are things a band might employ to try to crack the American market. It&#8217;s everything to be expected and dreaded from a Christmas song.</p>
<p><span id="more-924"></span></p>
<p>Yet the song, almost unknown in the United States, is repeatedly chosen in Irish, British and European polls as  <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/music-news/8957971/Fairytale-Of-New-York-is-true-sound-of-Christmas.html">the most popular Christmas song</a>. In the United States, only a small group of forty-somethings know of its existence. Even many who know and still love The Pogues (my wife included) strain to remember it. Indeed, I improvised over its melodies at some recent charity events as an entr&#8217;acte&#8211;of the many people who commented how beautiful it was, not one person could name the tune. My own feeling is that the song loses out in the US because of The Pogues&#8217; minor stature: Americans would embrace REM&#8217;s mixture of Southern Gothic and Stax Sound as the chosen hybrid of folk and alternative. The song&#8217;s critique of American consumerism does not help.</p>
<p>“Fairytale” is a four-minute, three movement oratorio of personal destruction that, by its end, offers only the hope of redemption. The first third is a slow waltz played as a barroom lament. “In the drunk tank,” an Irish immigrant realizes how far he has fallen and regrets the love he has lost. It&#8217;s not unlike &#8220;Bohemian Rhapsody&#8221;: the narrator has hit what may be the end of the road. Musically, this confessional is pure schmaltz, backed with piano and gentle strings. The reference to Irish moonshining, “<a title="Clancy Brothers' Mountain Dew" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PA_NN_NGzUs">The Rare Old Mountain Dew</a>,” roots the song in ethnic memory.</p>
<p>The jig-time second movement is a conversation between the immigrant and his love as their relationship deteriorates under the sights and sounds of New York on Christmas Eve. The holiday, American prosperity, the excitement of the city, the alcohol, and, finally, their own vices contribute to their disintegration. MacGowan and MacColl sing back and forth at a breathless pace. Tempo aside, it&#8217;s an easy melody that is simple to sing. Jem Finer and Terry Woods play the lilting melody on accordion and octave mandolin to bring the song more firmly into Irish folk music. Spider Stacy&#8217;s tin whistle joins in to counterpoint their melody. MacGowab and MacColl&#8217;s euphoria erupts into a violent argument, the couple hurling only the worst insults at each other: &#8220;Lying there almost dead on a drip in that bed&#8221;. “The boys of the NYPD choir were singing &#8216;Galway Bay&#8217;” is sung over the IV in an uplifting manner that is typical of so many great folk songs (think “Round yon virgin, mother and child” or “the words of the prophets were written on the subway walls.”)</p>
<p>The third section brings back the waltz theme. Band and orchestra play together as the immigrant admits the injuries he has caused and looks for the tiniest &#8216;something&#8217; on which to rebuild his relationship. &#8220;I could have been someone,&#8221; MacGowan sings. &#8220;Well, so could anyone,&#8221; MacColl retorts, &#8220;you took my dreams from me when I first found you.&#8221; The words sting, but MacColl delivers them in a deadpan manner, almost at the point of exhaustion. Having MacColl harmonize with herself over this section sounds out of place, even dated. Perhaps this was meant to emphasize that MacGowan is imagining a conversation that either he has yet to have or may never have. Regardless, the smoothness of MacColl&#8217;s delivery contrasts perfectly with MacGowan&#8217;s gruff, intoxicated singing.  It&#8217;s a realization of their interdependence and the possibility that there might be common ground between them: “can&#8217;t make it all alone, I&#8217;ve built my dreams around you.” After one more turn at the chorus, the band plays out the waltz melody backed by the lush orchestra.</p>
<p>“Fairytale of New York” is reality illuminated by the spirit of the Holidays—Christmas without the magic. It appears to run away from <em>It&#8217;s a Wonderful Life</em>: there is no divine intervention. But if there is no miracle for this couple, it&#8217;s hard to imagine they would reach this state—good and bad—if it were not Christmas Eve in the drunk tank. It allows McGowan to realize that something does really matter.</p>
<p>The greatest Christmas song? Maybe. “Fairytale of New York” fills two desires. It is a story with some gravitas, a representation of real-world relationships that can be re-examined and remade under the guise of the Holidays. On the other hand, it&#8217;s gorgeous pop music composed of folk themes, changing moods, uplifting choruses, and that “special holiday message.”  There is something of substance that is pulling at our heartstrings, which is what we hope we get from Holiday songs. The song is simply precious. It convinces me that there can be something special for everyone at this time of the year.</p>
