<p>Here is the mystery of <a href="https://lineimprint.bandcamp.com/album/monads"><em>Monads</em></a>. It is, by design, not an album of tunes, or even of nice, appealing drones. It is a collection of experiments in sound design, playing with frequencies and the odd bulges, strange eruptions, and frayed edges that emerge when sound itself is subjected to expert duress. It appears on the LINE label, which specializes in rarified noises that would puzzle many of my friends. It is an album that, save for one track, might be a shock to the system of anyone who comes to it from the melodic, pastoral beauty of a previous Hatami album such as <a href="http://noise.poryahatami.com/album/shallow"><em>Shallow</em></a>. It is the kind of album where the review ought to be about all the special equipment and arcane techniques employed to wrestle the novel sounds out of the ether.</p>
<p><span id="more-5399"></span></p>
<p>And yet….and yet it remains strangely musical, an album to which I find myself returning more than I thought I might. It evokes an enduring fascination. And that gets me wondering again what it is about recordings that most of my relatives would not concede to be music that nevertheless draws me in.</p>
<p>It helps that the sounds, odd, abstract, and alienated as they are, are never grating. The tonalities generated are varied, organic, and interesting and often in their own way winsome and tuneful, like an alien orchestra making music that escapes our cultural horizons. The soundscape is strange, but not creepy – only <em>7 (Verblendungszusammenhang)</em> sounds anxious. (At least to my ear; I have learned that the threshold of other family members can differ from mine.) <em>8 (Kurdish Folk Song)</em> is rather beautiful in texture and indeed somewhat song-like, provided the song is sung by space whales in the subterranean oceans of a moon orbiting Jupiter. It leaves me with a sense of wonder. The first key, then, is just to listen with attentive and open ears to the sounds themselves as they prance and swoop and loom, and to enjoy the specific pleasure of their textures, even as they sound like nothing at all but themselves.</p>
<p>And then, along with the textures, there is the ongoing sense of churning, wandering movement. There are, no beats or regular rhythms, yet nothing is still and the nature of the movement keeps shifting not only between, but within tracks. Take <em>3A</em>, a track that burbles forcefully with barely audible deep frequencies and bubbles insistently with a kind of turbulent air pressure. There is indeed no narrative, but there is a sense of life, of urgency, of something stirring in the depths. The next track, 3B, keeps a murmur of the deep but shifts the focus into the buzzing air, stuttering firefly-like over a calming hum as odd whistles swoop in obscure squiggles. The background of hiss of <em>4 (Phonetic)</em> reminds me of a river heard in the middle distance, but in the foreground percussive gusts swirl; after a while a rather train-like rhythm appears, and deforms, and vanishes again, too brief and abstracted to seem referential, yet nevertheless a moment where something familiar-seeming rises from the mist. The opening turbulence of <em>6A</em> might sit somewhere between the howling of winds and of creatures, yet the closing section feels more like a lap steel guitar played by zephyrs.</p>
<p>I do not mean to suggest that the album is programmatic, or to impose my own mind’s groping for this-worldly points of reference onto the material. I do not at all have the impression that the sounds are actually meant to paint objects in the world. And yet in their laying bare of primal sonic layers they at times feel like archetypes, evocations of a kind of basic energy trying to take form, evocations that speak of the ways that such energy swirls or buffets, howls or hums, looms or stutters in the fabric of reality. And in this sense the various sounds do feel to me rooted in the world. I am left thinking that if the album is about anything it is about the glories to be found in sound itself, in the myriad ways that energy can move through molecules and make beauty, ways hardly exhausted by all the more conventional tunes ever written.</p>
<p>Released back in April, Monads is not the most accessible Porya Hatami recording, but it may be one of his best. Check it out on <a href="http://www.lineimprint.com/">LINE</a> and stream it at <a href="https://lineimprint.bandcamp.com/album/monads">Bandcamp</a>.</p>

<p>This recent release floats up out of a yawning gap, so let&#8217;s back up the story a little for anyone who lost the thread. 1 Mile North’s first album, <a href="https://wortcunner.bandcamp.com/album/glass-wars"><em>Glass Wars</em></a>, was a collection of pretty guitar cogitations a little reminiscent in places of some of the quieter moments on <em>How Strange Innocence</em>, the first album by Explosions in the Sky from a year earlier. At the time it was one of quite a few of its kind floating around at the gently lyrical end of the post-rock spectrum. It was the second album, <a href="https://wortcunner.bandcamp.com/album/minor-shadows"><em>Minor Shadows</em></a>, released two years later in 2003, that made me sit up and take notice. While somewhat similar in feel to its predecessor, it achieved an increased tautness and sense of purpose and space, moving deftly from sparse beauty to wistful, melancholy drift to occasional pockets of darkness. It did not sound quite like any of its rivals, and it remains one of my most-returned-to albums from the post-rock binge that filled a chunk of my hard drive around that time. It’s a lonely, fragile, contemplative work, and the haunting opener “In 1983 he loved to fly” is to my ear perhaps its finest moment.</p>
<p><span id="more-5390"></span></p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5j1bp5ebFXE" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Apart from a split release a year later, that, was it. Thirteen years is a long time between album releases. It’s a testimony to the impression that <em>Minor Shadow</em>s made on me that I was still keeping an eye out every now and then to see if anything else might emerge. Late in 2016, a new album finally appeared, titled <em><a href="https://wortcunner.bandcamp.com/album/awakened-by-decay">Awakened by Decay</a> </em>and available on vinyl and digitally<em>.</em> This was interesting news, and I approached it with high hopes.</p>
<p>First impression: the minor shadows have become pools of darkness. The cover art is darker. The title leaves me wondering whether it alludes to fading musical notes or to awareness of the approaching end of life. The track titles circle around dark expanses, separations, absences. And yes, the music too is darker in hue, though without letting go of an underlying warmth carried by the silkily melodic phrases. It feels dark but not too bleak, like dark chocolate. The sense of profound patience and taut restraint is still there, there is still the atmospheric, almost hypnotic meditation on a few select notes. Yet where the earlier material often sounds to me like the attenuated air of wild open spaces, the new album, while firmly in the vein of the earlier material, feels more claustrophobic. The drones that accompany the plaintive guitar meditations are a touch heavier and more insistent, creating a tense undercurrent that tugs at the fragments of melody from beneath.</p>
<p>A comparison that comes to mind is late-period Labradford (that’s a huge compliment, by the way). The palette is sparse: a plangent guitar mutters phrases to itself, drones fill the air around it with a brooding mist, occasional languid percussion and piano add mesmerizing forward motion, a couple of snatches of spoken text drift by. The tracks are held together not so much by melody or dramatic arc as by the sheer tautness of the atmosphere in which they lazily swim. At some points I wonder if this is not so much music characterized by moodiness as moodiness distilled into aural form. It is music that asks a fair bit of the listener, calling for a contemplative patience, a willingness to languish in the slowly unfurling sounds, absorbed in the slowly swaying motion of the journey rather than expecting to be dazzled by any sudden landmarks along the way. A key test for this kind of thing is whether it can maintain the tension, avoid breaking the spell. It does not quite manage that equally strongly across the whole album to my ear—I have my favorite tracks—but there is a remarkable consistency of tone, with enough variety to hold my attention and nudge me onward. You won’t be humming it any time afterwards, but you might just get drawn into its rich, thick textures and meditative lyricism, and if you do, you’ll be glad you went along for the ride. Here&#8217;s hoping it&#8217;s not 13 years until the next installment.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As I prepared <a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//2016/12/top-20-of-2016-david-smith/">this year&#8217;s top 20 list</a>, I discovered that several of my favorite releases this year were not full albums, but brief EPs. Including them in the top 20 albums list felt a bit like trying to compare novels and short stories, so I decided to list them separately. These were my top 5 favorite EPs of 2016:</p>

A wonderful surprise at the end of the year: three Pjusk collaborations. Loscil, Porya Hatami, and SHAO add their musical perspectives, and the distinctive sound of Pjusk remains present in each track. Brilliant stuff.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><br />
<img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5360" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/top-20-of-2016-david-smith/bolton-lichen-150x150.jpg" alt="bolton-lichen" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/top-20-of-2016-david-smith/bolton-lichen-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/top-20-of-2016-david-smith/bolton-lichen-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/top-20-of-2016-david-smith/bolton-lichen.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" />#2. <a href="https://wilbolton.bandcamp.com/album/lichen">Wil Bolton &#8211; Lichen</a></strong><br />
Fifteen minutes of warm, spacious, crackly, resonant, luxuriant sound. My favorite of Wil Bolton&#8217;s several releases this year. Check out his <a href="https://wilbolton.bandcamp.com/album/maemi"><em>Maemi</em></a> EP and the full-length <em><a href="https://wilbolton.bandcamp.com/album/february-dawn">February Dawn</a> </em>as well.</p>

My list had its share of gentleness this year, but for moments when something more hard-edged fit the bill, this short collection of rumbling minimalist techno in the classic raster-noton vein was an excellent stand-by.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><br />
<img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5363" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/top-20-of-2016-david-smith/Murcof-EP01-150x150.jpg" alt="murcof-ep01" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/top-20-of-2016-david-smith/Murcof-EP01-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/top-20-of-2016-david-smith/Murcof-EP01-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/top-20-of-2016-david-smith/Murcof-EP01.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" />#4. <a href="https://infine-rec.bandcamp.com/album/ep01">Murcof and Vanessa Wagner &#8211; EP01</a></strong><br />
By turns darkly brooding and gently melancholy, this turbulent-electronics-meets-Satie release stuck with me even after the full-length album that followed it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5364" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/top-20-of-2016-david-smith/Jazzdefector-150x150.jpg" alt="jazzdefector" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/top-20-of-2016-david-smith/Jazzdefector-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/top-20-of-2016-david-smith/Jazzdefector-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/top-20-of-2016-david-smith/Jazzdefector.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /><strong>#5. <a href="https://audiogourmet.bandcamp.com/album/miniatures">Jazzdefector &#8211; Miniatures</a></strong></p>
<p>Finally, something more relaxing. A series of very short pieces of effects-laden guitar offer a summery interlude, warm and pretty.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s been a quiet 2016 at <em>Metelaifne Music</em>. Professional commitments have left some regulars with less time for blogging. But we&#8217;re still listening. Here are my top 20 albums for 2016. I excluded compilations (though <a href="http://shop.serein.co.uk/album/orbital-planes-passenger-trains-vol-1"><em>Orbital Planes &amp; Passenger Trains, Vol. 1</em></a> from Serein, <a href="https://dronarivm.bandcamp.com/album/into-the-white-new-years-2016-free-compilation"><em>Into the White</em></a> from Dronarivm, and <a href="https://www.fat-cat.co.uk/release/eleven-into-fifteen-a-130701-compilation"><em>Eleven into Fifteen</em></a> from 130701 all delighted me). As ever, this is the best in my subjective judgment of what I heard and liked, no more, and the numbering is less important than the chance of helping someone find something good that they missed. This year I am treating EPs separately, <a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//?p=5331&#038;preview=true">in a second post</a>.<span id="more-5329"></span></p>

<p><strong>#1.</strong> <a href="https://federicodurand.bandcamp.com/album/a-trav-s-del-espejo"><strong>Federico Durand – A Través Del Espejo</strong></a><br />
This delightful album was released on 12k early in the year, and I kept listening to it all year. (My wife liked it too, which is far from guaranteed with the more experimental fringes of my listening.) A childlike celebration of tiny, fragile sounds, and a reminder of what can be destroyed by noise and bombast, this album offers a series of delicate meditations on the vulnerable beauty of sound. Durand&#8217;s <a href="https://federicodurand.bandcamp.com/"><em>Jardín de invierno</em></a> (on Spekk) deserves honorable mention in the same vein, but it was this earlier release that captivated my ears the most this year.</p>

The haunting first track displays magnificently Jaar&#8217;s precise mastery of his palette of sounds. The album continues with a compelling sideways take on a variety of song forms, with the thematic focus on a culture of political violence providing a dark textual undercurrent. A remarkable piece of work, whether one focuses on the catchy songs, on the textual warnings, or on the meticulously shaped sonic shifts.</p>

<p>#<strong>3. <a href="https://kaitlynaureliasmith.bandcamp.com/album/frkwys-vol-13-sunergy">Kaitlyn Aurelia Smith &amp; Suzanne Ciani &#8211; Sunergy</a></strong><br />
An inspired set of Buchla synthesizer improvisations from a senior master of the art and a new rising star (Smith&#8217;s solo album <a href="https://kaitlynaureliasmith.bandcamp.com/album/ears"><em>Ears</em></a> this year was also excellent). Sequences burble and sparkle over shifting hums and currents, providing a compelling update to the long-form analog synthesizer genre.</p>

What if Brian Eno&#8217;s classic ambient work, <em>Music for Airports,</em> were recorded as a jazz album? Chris Schlarb showed us this year that the results could be very enjoyable indeed. We also get a new, complementary piece, the &#8220;working man&#8217;s counterpart&#8221; to music for airports titled &#8220;Music for Bus Stops.&#8221; Both pieces charmed me.</p>

An acoustic guitar meanders gently and peacefully as an unsettled bed of chirping, buzzing, warbling, squeaking electronics chatters tensely alongside, setting up a fascinating conversation that sometimes produces tension, sometimes converges.</p>

Ostermeier &#8211; Tiny Birds</a></strong><br />
Building on last year&#8217;s <em>Still</em>, M. Ostermeier returned with an aptly titled collection of short, plaintive piano pieces. Accompanied by background rustles and rattles, the tracks are sparse, stark, melancholy, almost hesitant in their deliberation. The sound is intimate, inviting us to slow down and attend rather than carrying us along.</p>

David Newman&#8217;s recent releases have struck an absorbing balance between experimental exploration of the properties of sound and a melodic presence, and this collaboration with Justin Varis continues in the same rich vein. Remixes by various luminaries of the genre add a further dimension to this charming collection of off-kilter pieces.</p>

Korwar takes field recordings of folk music from Indian villages and marries them with jazz and electronics so skilfully that it is hard to see the joins. Raw recordings of chant and percussion from India provide the substrate that morphs into engaging jazz sequences that extend the sources without leaving them behind. A striking, unusual release.</p>

Loscil continues to find new angles on his distinctive sound, and his latest contains some of his most aggressive rhythms to date. It also serves up a fresh helping of his signature hypnotically shimmering pulses. I have never met a Loscil album I didn&#8217;t like, and this latest release more than kept the streak going.</p>

Resonant guitar notes follow one another at a gentle, leisurely pace. An ethereal atmosphere builds amid their resonance. Chiming rhythms eventually arrive, but only accentuate the calm. The album drifts by lazily, a slow caress.</p>

An evocative follow-up to Tiento de las Nieves, Tiento de la Luz offers a glacially paced interaction of piano, viola da gamba, and electronics. As usual with Köner, deep frequencies and extended textures play an important role, with the decay of each note held before us for contemplation. Mesmerizing listening.</p>

<p><strong>#12. <a href="https://slaapwel.bandcamp.com/album/filament">Gareth Davis &#8211; Filament</a></strong><br />
A rich, undulating, 35-minute drone, embedded in field recordings of the ocean, gains texture from the use of bass and contrabass clarinet along with electronics. Deep rumbles and whale-song-like squeaks ebb, and flow, and sway to deeply atmospheric effect.</p>

<p>The Native American sonic references may be a little hokey here and there, but the more I listened to this release from French jazz bass veteran Henri Texier the more the tunes sank their hooks into me.

<p>Piano again, now heard through a rich haze of sonic manipulation, tinkling amid a crackle and rush of air, emerging from a busy hum, chiming like bells, meandering sadly, punctuating an ominous buzz. Porya Hatami and Uwe Zahn keep shifting the sonic palette a little, crowding the electronic atmosphere with portent as the piano soldiers bravely on.</p>

This is not background music. It seems at any given moment as if little is happening, yet the whole unfolds in a way that feels tautly dramatic, like a small movie made of slight violin scrapes, hisses, metallic reverberations, wordless vocalizations, the sounds of something important happening, just over the horizon and almost out of earshot.</p>

Nils Frahm got together with some childhood friends to revisit and remix some tapes they had made decades ago. The result is a collection of atmospheric lo-fi instrumentals that somehow manage to sound reminiscent of Frahm&#8217;s solo work while being little like his previous material in form.</p>

McClure trades more in precise measures of sound than in tunes. Each track on this immersive, painstakingly crafted album invites the listener to meditate on a specific quality of carefully constructed sound, ranging from the nature-tinged water-and-hum of the opening track to almost-not-there gossamer drones and unexpected pulses.</p>

There are stretches in which this album sounds like a gaggle of synthesizers improvising by themselves, without human intervention. Bright, chiming sounds ripple and cascade merrily. Stick around, though, and the two long pieces begin to develop and morph, building into rich swathes of sound.</p>

Drone and noise, crackle and hum, chaotic dissolution of sound and a massive sense of grandeur &#8211; these are the basic building blocks of <em>Continuum</em>. Jebanasam sets out to capture &#8220;the spectrum of life, power and energy present in the universe&#8221; and emerges with a dramatic set of drone compositions.</p>

The practically ungooglable title gave me some trouble tracking down this unusual release. It began from recordings of the sounds of bees in their hives and built instrumental compositions around the bee drones and buzzes. The music is pastoral, and the interweaving of natural and instrumental sounds is quite sensitively done.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>24. Speedy Ortiz – <em>Foil Deer</em></strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-april-21-2015/Speedy-Ortiz-Foil-Deer.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-4976"><img class="alignleft wp-image-4976 size-thumbnail" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-april-21-2015/Speedy-Ortiz-Foil-Deer-150x150.jpg" alt="Speedy Ortiz - Foil Deer" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-april-21-2015/Speedy-Ortiz-Foil-Deer-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-april-21-2015/Speedy-Ortiz-Foil-Deer.jpg 280w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a>Speedy Ortiz’s previous releases were enjoyable, but often lacked the hooks to take the band to the next level.  <em>Foil Deer</em> does not have that deficiency. It has hooks for days.  Sadie Dupuis’ voice and the album’s guitar tones bring to mind 90s artists like Liz Phair and Veruca Salt, but <em>Foil Deer</em> is noise pop for this generation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>23. Chvrches – <em>Every Open Eye</em></strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-25-of-2015-craig-mcmanus/Chvrches-Every-Open-Eye.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-5266"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5266" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-25-of-2015-craig-mcmanus/Chvrches-Every-Open-Eye-150x150.jpg" alt="Chvrches - Every Open Eye" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-25-of-2015-craig-mcmanus/Chvrches-Every-Open-Eye-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-25-of-2015-craig-mcmanus/Chvrches-Every-Open-Eye.jpg 280w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a>The best word to describe <em>Every Open Eye </em>is &#8216;pristine.&#8217;  The album sees Chvrches bring their brand of indie, synth pop ever closer to the pop mainstream.  In fact, there is no doubt that a little Top 40 radio airplay would see the band deservedly break through that barrier.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>22. Young Thug – <em>Barter 6</em></strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-april-21-2015/Young-Thug-Barter-6.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-4977"><img class="alignleft wp-image-4977 size-thumbnail" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-april-21-2015/Young-Thug-Barter-6-150x150.jpg" alt="Young Thug - Barter 6" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-april-21-2015/Young-Thug-Barter-6-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-april-21-2015/Young-Thug-Barter-6.jpg 280w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a><em>Barter 6</em> is Young Thug at his insane best. It’s hooky, full of intricate flows and odd bars, and of course features Thugga’s distinctive voice.  Where this tape stands out among Thug&#8217;s output of the last couple years, however, is the production.  The beats here are almost languid and Thug’s flow often slows down to ride in the pocket.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>21. Lower Dens – <em>Escape From Evil</em></strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-march-31-2015/Lower-Dens-Escape-From-Evil.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-4964"><img class="alignleft wp-image-4964 size-thumbnail" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-march-31-2015/Lower-Dens-Escape-From-Evil-150x150.jpg" alt="Lower Dens - Escape From Evil" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-march-31-2015/Lower-Dens-Escape-From-Evil-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-march-31-2015/Lower-Dens-Escape-From-Evil.jpg 280w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a>Lower Dens&#8217; prior releases were heavily indebted to shoegaze/dream pop sounds.<em> Escape From Evil</em>, however, introduces a dancey, new wave aesthetic.  Drums and bass drive the album and give it a bounce that hasn’t existed for the band before. Even with the new direction, however, the band’s music rises and falls with Jana Hunter’s strong alto vocals, and <em>Escape From Evil</em> has far more rise than fall.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>20. Miguel – <em>Wildheart</em></strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-june-30-2015/Miguel-Wildheart.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-5154"><img class="alignleft wp-image-5154 size-thumbnail" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-june-30-2015/Miguel-Wildheart-150x150.jpg" alt="Miguel - Wildheart" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-june-30-2015/Miguel-Wildheart-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-june-30-2015/Miguel-Wildheart.jpg 280w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a>Full of guitars, explicit lyrics, and largely shunning obvious hooks to rely on an album wide atmosphere to draw in the listener, <em>Wildheart</em> isn’t about sex.  It is sex.  There&#8217;s really nothing more that needs said.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>19. Rae Sremmurd – <em>SremmLife</em></strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-january-6-2015/Rae-Sremmurd-SremmLife.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-4788"><img class="alignleft wp-image-4788 size-thumbnail" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-january-6-2015/Rae-Sremmurd-SremmLife-150x150.jpg" alt="Rae Sremmurd - SremmLife" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-january-6-2015/Rae-Sremmurd-SremmLife-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-january-6-2015/Rae-Sremmurd-SremmLife.jpg 280w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a>Rae Sremmurd first made waves in 2014 due to a sound that bridges the gap between chart rap and the codeine rap currently coming out of Atlanta.  Their debut album is no different.  Produced by Mike WiLL Made It, <em>SremmLife</em> is bouncy southern trap made for serious partying, with no concern for what comes tomorrow.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>18. Unknown Mortal Orchestra – <em>Multi Love</em></strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-may-26-2015/Unknown-Mortal-Orchestra-Multi-Love-e1432648730360.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-5067"><img class="alignleft wp-image-5067 size-thumbnail" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-may-26-2015/Unknown-Mortal-Orchestra-Multi-Love-150x150.jpg" alt="Unknown Mortal Orchestra - Multi-Love" width="150" height="150" /></a>The music of <em>Multi-Love</em> is the familiar psych pop of Unknown Mortal Orchestra’s first two releases, but the lyrics focus largely on Ruban Nielson’s emotions as he and his wife attempted to navigate a summer living in polyamory.  Taken together, the music and lyrics form an incredibly raw whole that is both beautiful and terrifying.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>The Most Lamentable Tragedy</em> may not be Titus Andronicus’ best album, but due to its in-depth focus on mental illness it is easily their most important.  The lyrics, dark and beautiful, despairing and hopeful, are what frontman Patrick Stickles has been building towards for his entire career, and are devastatingly important.</p>

<p>En&#8217;s last album, <em>Already Gone</em>, (<a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//2012/04/review-already-gone-by-en/" target="_blank">review here</a>) was notable both for its distinctive palette of sounds and for its cohesion. It offered a succession of tracks of increasing length, culminating and resolving in a 20-minute meditation on <em>Elysium</em>, the mythical Greek isle of the blessed. <a href="http://studentsofdecay.com/post/132222852294/en-city-of-brides" target="_blank"><em>City of Brides</em> </a>(the title of the new double LP and of its closing track &#8211; another eschatological tinge, I wonder?) is less linear. Indeed it thrives on a restless exploration of shifting and contrasting sounds, skipping from noise to clarity, from stasis to rippling motion, from soft to abrasive as we wander from moment to moment and from track to track. And yet there remains a sense of deep unity, as if the various tracks are somehow probing the same question, prodding at the same possibility.<span id="more-5200"></span></p>
<p>The opener, <em>Blades</em>, greets us with a melodic buzz of distorted, metallic tones that gyrate their way into an encroaching bed of noise until they end up circling in a sludgy loop. It seems a rather abrasive beginning, especially to ears that remember <em>Elysium</em>, but somehow makes sense as we hit the sudden contrast with its successor. The abrupt clarity of the resounding clusters of plucked koto notes that begin <em>Dead Ringer</em> is a startling shift, yet those notes too begin to buzz with a growing halo of distortion, until the clear opening notes finally reassert themselves. Listening to this track after <em>Blades</em> is a little like reading a novel in which the scene suddenly shifts to a new location which turns out to be part of the same story. Then <em>Blonde is Back</em> takes us down another path, plunging us into a warmly drifting wash of sound punctuated by subtle bass thrums, dreamy and soft &#8211; and yet embedded in a continuing abrasive buzz that retains a thread of continuity with the preceding tracks. As the buzz recedes, the whole slowly submerges in a gauzy sea of synthetic whispers. We have been led through three contrasting sound worlds, three sonic rooms, apparently held together by the halo of noise through which they emerge.</p>
<p>The same sense of contrast and continuity plays throughout the album. The wittily titled <em>Awkward Paws</em> offers pattering drops of sound echoing in a gentle haze, before a flock of strings flurries past like a sudden patter of rain, leaving behind a clean, peaceful drone, clearly evoking motifs from <em>Already Gone</em>. Just as we ease into rest, a scratchy, percussive abrasion interrupts the reverie and jolts us into the wonderful <em>Mendocino Nature Rave</em>. The earthy creaking anchors a more spacey realm of quavering, whooshing, synthetic sounds. The swoops and oscillations gather in increasing density, creating a deliciously rich, twittering crescendo that marries depth and majesty with eddying motion before fading into a spray of echoing pulses. This pair of tracks highlights a recurring duality in En’s music, which offers contrasting paths to bliss: a restful calm evoked by warmly and sedately swaying tones, or an accumulation of so many simultaneously scurrying, circling flurries of sound that a kind of deep grandeur emerges, like all the creatures of the world glimpsed at once in motion. (<em>Secret Samba</em> offers another very effective instance of this latter effect.)</p>
<p>Two of the tracks form a dyad. <em>Songs for Diminished Lovemaking Part 1</em> initially calms the proceedings with a steady, soft drone before bright sweeps of reedy sound rise from it and swirl restlessly, questing upward over a slight, gentle rhythm until the track quietly draws to a close. A few tracks later, <em>Part 2</em> opens morosely with a subdued hum, deep gurgles, and a forlorn scrape of strings straining to attain forward motion. The effort is repeated with gradually increasing force and breadth of sound until a grander resonance is attained, like an orchestra tuning while trying to rise from a bubbling swamp. Further adding to the loose sense of architecture, the scratchy rhythms, bubbling synthetic sounds, and gritty crackles of album closer <em>City of Brides</em> create a blend of melody and noise that recalls the opening track.</p>
<p>En&#8217;s music is not about well-defined shapes and clear edges. Patterns overlap, swirl in moiré motion, and dissolve, warm drones wobble and sway at a languid distance, and clear, sharp notes emerge only as fleeting moments of orientation. Pervading both <em>Already Gone</em> and <em>City of Brides</em> is a nostalgic evocation of a blurry transcendence, a gesture toward a world of fluttering beauty and healing calm heard through the mist of dreams, through the indistinct sway of a warm ocean, or through a grainy filter of imperfection. En&#8217;s music evokes without clearly naming, painting in sound a world not quite graspable but beautiful nonetheless. It leaves a lasting impression and amply rewards repeated listening.

<p>I didn&#8217;t plan to write a review tonight. But the CD was playing and it caught me up and carried me away and I had to write&#8230;</p>
<p>Wil Bolton&#8217;s music is part of the texture of my world. I always enjoy his releases to one degree or another, but a handful of them have risen from &#8220;this is nice&#8221; to &#8220;this is one of my favorite things&#8221;. The expressive chimes of <a href="https://wilbolton.bandcamp.com/album/time-lapse" target="_blank"><em>Time Lapse</em></a> and <a href="https://wilbolton.bandcamp.com/album/chimes-for-a-wall-drawing" target="_blank"><em>Chimes for a Wall Drawing</em></a> call forth wonder and remain in my listening rotation years after their release.<span id="more-5185"></span> <a href="https://soundcloud.com/distant-noise-records/wil-tarl-angel-in-the-house" target="_blank">Angel in the House</a>, by Wil &amp; Tarl, is a marvelous drone piece. The last several releases I have enjoyed, but they did not quite creep up onto my inner list of most-favored recordings. And then <a href="https://wilbolton.bandcamp.com/album/inscriptions" target="_blank">Inscriptions</a> came along on Moscow&#8217;s consistently excellent <a href="https://dronarivm.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank">Dronarivm</a> label and charmed me completely.</p>
<p>At the outset, little, softly darting sounds and questing essays on guitar strings draw us into a lush bed of sound, a title track astir with possibility, caressing the air with a gentle, exploratory touch. A deep, rich drone forms an enveloping bed and the guitar notes, rather than playing over or in front of it, seem increasingly to emerge from it and sigh back into its velvety texture. A tight flurry of pulses recurs from time to time, restating an inchoate question. We could rest here for a long time, quite still and in perpetual motion. <em>Hedera</em>, track 2, is for me perhaps the high point of a consistently strong album. A warm droning loop sways sedately, its constant round-and-round-and-up-and-down motion as mesmerizing and soothing as the gentle sway of a kelp forest in a tropical sea. The guitar meditates in a loose, questing pattern as bird cries and small, darting buzzes weave intricately around the sounds. The overall effect is detailed and fascinating, and as warm and wallowing as a fresh-run bath on a winter evening. That the track sways on for some time without departing from its message is part of its success; I never want it to end.</p>
<p>End it does, but <em>Seed</em> picks up right where it left off. It modulates the tone a little, adds some human sounds of children playing and some creaks and crackles, offers a slightly more purposeful guitar pattern, and sways ever onward. As I listen I am again impressed with how complex the mood is. This music is warm and comforting. It is melancholy and wistful. It is gently affirming of world and life. It is nostalgic and thoughtful. It is questioning and pensive. It is often all of these things at the same time, a restful restlessness that allows the listener to ease back and relax in the swell or become fully engaged in the rich textures.</p>
<p>Track four is called <em>Cathedral</em>. Again everything is the same and everything is different, the guitar more skittish, the drone more plaintive, the space evoked by the field recordings more open and seeking, reaching more than circling. Rather than placing us in the intimate company of fellow creatures (birds, children), this track gives a sense of being in the presence of unseen events, of things moving we know not where. <em>Limestone</em>, the final track, wells up warmly, aswirl with crackling light and hope, and eddies us gently with harp-like flurries to a restful end.</p>
<p>And then comes the repeat button.</p>
<p>To say this is my favorite Wil Bolton album is already to say that I like it better than some of my favorite albums, period. I spent the summer wondering what would be high on of my end-of-year list &#8211; I had heard nice things this year, but nothing that had given me that sense that a magical gift had come my way. This is one of those gifts, and I am still gratefully falling in love with it.</p>
<p>I did not plan to write a review tonight. But the CD was playing and it caught me up and carried me along and I had to write&#8230;and fortunately the music is much better than my writing. Stream it below, buy it at Bandcamp and other online stores, luxuriate in it.</p>

<p>Germany&#8217;s Arovane has been putting out some striking ambient material of late, including the recent <a href="https://arovane.bandcamp.com/album/dwell-tevvel-structure" target="_blank">dwell_tevvel_structure</a> on the UK label <a href="http://www.txtrecordings.co.uk/" target="_blank">…txt recordings</a>. I have no idea what a <em>tevvel</em> is, and neither does Google; it&#8217;s an anagram of velvet and bears a passing resemblance to the Dutch teviel (&#8220;too much&#8221;), but who knows if that is relevant. <em>Dwelling</em>, in the sense of settling down and taking time, and <em>structure</em>, here in the form of careful layers of sound, are both terms that illuminate the music on this album. The album consists of four long sound pieces (ranging from 14 to 20 minutes), each with its own distinct character yet tied together sonically in an arc that suggests four movements of a whole. The first opens with a gently undulating drift and fluttering patters of brightness &#8211; perhaps it&#8217;s the cover art, but I find it hard not to think of sunlight sparkling on waves. <span id="more-5183"></span>The effect is relaxing and peaceful in the way the movement of a thousand leaves in a tree in sudden breeze is peaceful. The second track is more subdued, hushed, and grainy. Textured and smooth layers of sound take turns coming to the fore. After a while we are left with an airy but somber machine hum, until faint celestial tones begin to play at the edge of hearing, and almost imperceptibly the enveloping hum warms in tone until it slides into silence. The third track opens with a steady stream of deliciously layered sound, defying the ear to pick out all the strata &#8211; the tiny pulses, the fricative halo around the gentle rasp, the quiet hum, the resonant space around the sounds. The slightest changes come and go as the track streams onward, one of those quietly demanding pieces where nothing at all is happening until you really listen. The final track recalls the first, taking us back to bright open spaces and rushing flurries of sound, this time a little more buoyant and sharply accented. The whole work focuses on layering sound upon sound and giving the rich textures that cause time to stretch out and slowly unfold their different facets. There is lots to enjoy here for the patient listener.</p>
<div id="attachment_5187" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5187" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/review-dwell_tevvel_structure-by-arovane-and-resonance-by-arovane-porya-hatami/Resonance-300x300.jpg" alt="Resonance by Arovane + Porya Hatami" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/review-dwell_tevvel_structure-by-arovane-and-resonance-by-arovane-porya-hatami/Resonance-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/review-dwell_tevvel_structure-by-arovane-and-resonance-by-arovane-porya-hatami/Resonance-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/review-dwell_tevvel_structure-by-arovane-and-resonance-by-arovane-porya-hatami/Resonance.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p class="wp-caption-text"><em>Resonance by Arovane + Porya Hatami</em></p></div>
<p>Hot on the heels of that release comes a collaboration with Porya Hatami that has an entirely different feel. <a href="http://store.eter-lab.net/album/resonance" target="_blank" class="broken_link"><strong>Resonance</strong></a> (each track is named for a consecutive letter in the word) on Columbian <a href="http://store.eter-lab.net/music" target="_blank" class="broken_link">Éter records</a>, is darker, denser, a restlessly chattering conversation of small, dark sounds with some startling twists and turns. The album opens with a metallic glistening and an ominous hum, around which other fragments begin to bustle. Hatami&#8217;s releases have most often had a pastoral and rustic bent, but the world evoked here feels darker, more industrial, digital machines burbling and chiming in a cavernous, deserted factory. Things creak and stretch and tumble with resonant clatter as what sound like piano strings are struck, and strummed. A squelchy rhythm begins, haloed by a faint glow, before opening up into the album&#8217;s first contemplative stretch, a delicious blend of hum and hiss and tone that undulates gently for a while before sliding away into gentleness like waves receding. Then the computers are back to their grimly chiming cogitations, evolving into a nighttime jungle of electronic creatures. The electronic backdrop is joined by what sound more like actual bird calls, a dark machine world and nighttime nature merging before mournful strings emerge to add a human note to the scene. Drones layer into a glowing dawn, which abruptly ends in a brief and startling snatch of woozy jazz piano. The pattern of claustrophobically chittering machines, organic rustlings, and more peaceful, expansive tones repeats. As we reach the second N, ResonaNce, the world is brighter, more hopeful, burbling against crackling bright skies of sound. But then things turn ominous again, busy creaks and rustles return, like a wooden ship shifting darkly at its midnight mooring. The temperature drops and unseen presences whisper, until the woozy piano puts in a brief reprise, only to be overcome by a densely humming clatter. The whole is quite abstract and a little eerie, though not shapeless &#8211; a recurring strategy is to end busy pieces with brief closing sections that take them in quite different directions. A sense of being surrounded by small, unidentifiable events and uneasy dialogue between sound worlds makes for an album that is far from soothing but quite thought-provoking on close listening.</p>

The last before the current release was Porya Hatami’s <a title="Shallow review" href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//2014/04/review-shallow-and-the-black-woodpecker-by-porya-hatami/" target="_blank"><em>Shallow</em></a>, over a year ago. The latest is from label head M. Ostermeier, and its title, <em>Still</em>, succinctly yet accurately captures its mood.</p>
<p>Listening to this album the first half dozen times I found myself having to repeatedly reorient my horizon of expectation despite the apparent consistency of its palette. The album opens with an oscillating hum, over which a slow piano meditation begins, soon accompanied by a background of small creaks and rustles. The sound put me in mind of the intimacy of Nils Frahm’s <em>Felt</em>, in which the creakings of the piano itself are an important presence that adds to the emotional intimacy.<span id="more-4986"></span> The piano presence on <em>Still</em>, however, soon turns out to be starker, more distant, more austerely and repetitively meditative. As the hum continues to anchor the track I begin to think more of Alva Noto and Ryuichi Sakamoto’s collaborations, in which the intersection of laptop and piano is explored. But this reference too passes. Despite the oscillating wave, the small scurryings, the piano figures, there is a deep stillness at the heart of the track captured in its title, &#8220;Stasis.&#8221; Single piano gestures cluster in patterns but the space between them precludes momentum; after a while I am reminded more of releases such as Kenneth Kirschner’s <em>Twenty Ten</em> or Thomas Köner’s <em>Tiento de las Nieves</em>, where each piano sound is held up for contemplation rather than taking its place in the moving walkway of melody.</p>
<p>The second track picks up almost seamlessly from the first, except that the hum departs and the rustlings and scrapings pick up pace, clearly much more now than mere environmental creaks and whispers. The balance of the elements is shifting. The piano is as stark as ever but behind it a small world of hurried motion flutters in parallel. The track is called &#8220;Division.&#8221; &#8220;Hang,&#8221; a brief interlude, keeps only the piano, which takes on a more plaintive voice. After the uncompromising starkness of the opening three tracks, I am ready for something to shift, and shift it does.</p>
<p>&#8220;Counterpoise&#8221; is hardly brash, but after the stillness that precedes it, it arrives with startling vivacity. An electronic pulse with a skittering beat replaces the piano, and at first it feels like the start of a different album, lighter and more motile. Before long, however, the piano is reintegrated, and so are the background tappings, but now clustered rhythmically and given varying dynamics, like a hesitant accompanist on a typewriter. Clicks and pops add to the unsteady rhythms, and the overall effect is quite delightful. &#8220;New Lights&#8221; drops the new electronic movement to a dappled whisper over which it explores more hopeful-sounding chords, before &#8220;Congruence&#8221; pairs the piano once more with a prominent hum. &#8220;Inertia&#8221; continues that hum and has small foreground sounds visit it – by now the sense of inversion is complete, as if the small background rustles of the first track have by now become the actual narrative. This is the longest track and it has returned us to a deep sense of stillness. The closing track, &#8220;Parity,&#8221; sounds more lugubrious than any track so far, ominous in tone, the piano questioning and leaving us hanging for a response before resolving on a resigned note and then fading out with the echo of a more ambiguous chord.</p>
<p>There is an almost mathematical sense of combinatorial possibilities about the whole album, as each track reveals subtly different combinations of a basic set of elements, adding and subtracting to create slight shifts of mood, pitting light against shadow, stillness against motion. Yet there is nothing mechanistic about the sounds, which evoke a contingent, human world and invite a meditative attentiveness to each note, each rattle, each resonance. It is an album that calls for patience and in return casts a slow spell, drawing the listener through a slowly shifting landscape of thoughtful sound. Another fine release from Tench, <em>Still</em> is recommended for close listening. Order it <a title="Tench shop" href="http://www.tenchrec.com/catalog.html" target="_blank">here</a>.<br />

<p>Porya Hatami increased his profile in 2014 with a string of excellent releases on various labels. <a title="Tench" href="http://www.tenchrec.com/TCH06.html"><em>Shallow</em></a> was my <a title="Top 20 of 2014: David Smith" href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//2014/12/top-20-of-2014-david-smith/" target="_blank">favorite album of the year</a>, and I am still listening to it regularly a year after its release. (Review and stream <a title="Review: Shallow (and The Black Woodpecker) by Porya Hatami" href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//2014/04/review-shallow-and-the-black-woodpecker-by-porya-hatami/" target="_blank">here</a>.) It was therefore intriguing to learn that a <a title="Shallow Remixed" href="http://dewtonerecordings.com/album/shallow-remixed" target="_blank">remix album </a>was in the works, with contributions from notables such as Loscil and The Green Kingdom. Would it extend the listening pleasure or render the sublime mundane?<span id="more-4893"></span></p>
<p>It has to be said that the success of this remix collection as a whole hangs to a considerable degree on what one makes of the idea of adding beats to an original that focused not on conventional rhythms, but on organically unfolding sighs, splashes, and chimes, an unhurried field of natural play and refracted light coaxed into lazily emergent patterns. Those who prefer a beat to their music may like these versions better &#8211; the marriage of Hatami&#8217;s textures to gentle beats does produce some very pleasant electronic music. For me, a few of the tracks that adopt the strategy of adding a regular, techno-descended rhythm to background textures drawn from <em>Shallow</em> crash sideways into my love for the gentle sunlight-on-raindrops order of the original.</p>
<p>There are, however enough successes to carry the day, even for my somewhat beat-averse ear. The closing minute or so of Halo&#8217;s reworking of &#8216;After the Rain&#8217; carries on a delicate dialogue between a piano meditation and shimmering sounds from Hatami&#8217;s original to delightful effect. The suite of remixes of &#8216;White Forest&#8217; unfolds particularly enjoyably. Purl&#8217;s version manages to add less mechanical rhythms to the original in a way that meshes with its texture and avoids losing its sense of openness and wonder. The track blends nicely into the version by Nikosf., which corrals Hatami&#8217;s chiming flurries into a looping rhythmic pattern and gives it equal footing in the mix with the added percussion, thereby keeping the tone of the original to the fore. Arovane&#8217;s version comes closer still to getting a glitschy rhythm to undergird and highlight the tones and moods of &#8216;White Forest,&#8217; resulting in one of the more successful tracks on the album.</p>
<p>For me, the biggest highlights of the album are the opening and closing tracks. Both attempt something a little bolder than the rest, and both succeed splendidly.</p>
<p>Loscil&#8217;s opener, a remix of &#8216;Fen&#8217;, begins with a breathy texture that is recognizably the opening to Fen, but abstracted from its earthy, watery moorings into something more airy. It deepens and broadens beautifully before birthing a classic Loscil burbling/pulsing rhythm upon which fleeting touches of brighter sound surf like whitecaps. The result is in the end more Loscil than Hatami, but as a fan of both I find it quite delightful.</p>
<p>The closing track, a remix of &#8216;White Forest&#8217; by <a title="Bandcamp" href="http://dewtonerecordings.com/album/forgotten-hearts" target="_blank">Bjorn Rohde</a>, is one of the few to pick up from Shallow not just its sound palette but the sense of compositional structure that helped raise it above many superficially similar ambient releases. The track moves through several phases. It opens with a deep and boldly resonant piano note and a camera whirr that grab the attention precisely because the sudden gestures depart from the looping rhythms of the album this far. It moves through a series of rustling modulations of sounds from &#8216;White Forest&#8217; that are quite faithful to the original track&#8217;s sound world while foregrounding fresh details and adding a series of melodic and rhythmic motifs that ebb and flow deliciously, keeping us on a stately journey to a reprise of the opening gestures at the end. At almost 13 minutes (slightly longer than the original) it is the only track as ambitious in scope as the source material, and it is the track that best recaptures and extends the magic of that material. It is a wonderful addition to the world of <em>Shallow</em>, and a charming parting gift.</p>
<p>In some ways I was a tough customer to please with an album of <em>Shallow</em> remixes. Loving the original as much as I do, remixing it was likely to be like substituting ingredients in a favorite recipe or messing with the plot of a favorite novel. In the end, the album as a whole turns out to be quite enjoyable. Happily, there are even a few real gems, standout successes that uncover the strength of the source material and coax fresh pleasures from it. For those I am particularly grateful.</p>
