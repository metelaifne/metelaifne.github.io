<p>This recent release floats up out of a yawning gap, so let&#8217;s back up the story a little for anyone who lost the thread. 1 Mile North’s first album, <a href="https://wortcunner.bandcamp.com/album/glass-wars"><em>Glass Wars</em></a>, was a collection of pretty guitar cogitations a little reminiscent in places of some of the quieter moments on <em>How Strange Innocence</em>, the first album by Explosions in the Sky from a year earlier. At the time it was one of quite a few of its kind floating around at the gently lyrical end of the post-rock spectrum. It was the second album, <a href="https://wortcunner.bandcamp.com/album/minor-shadows"><em>Minor Shadows</em></a>, released two years later in 2003, that made me sit up and take notice. While somewhat similar in feel to its predecessor, it achieved an increased tautness and sense of purpose and space, moving deftly from sparse beauty to wistful, melancholy drift to occasional pockets of darkness. It did not sound quite like any of its rivals, and it remains one of my most-returned-to albums from the post-rock binge that filled a chunk of my hard drive around that time. It’s a lonely, fragile, contemplative work, and the haunting opener “In 1983 he loved to fly” is to my ear perhaps its finest moment.</p>
<p><span id="more-5390"></span></p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5j1bp5ebFXE" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Apart from a split release a year later, that, was it. Thirteen years is a long time between album releases. It’s a testimony to the impression that <em>Minor Shadow</em>s made on me that I was still keeping an eye out every now and then to see if anything else might emerge. Late in 2016, a new album finally appeared, titled <em><a href="https://wortcunner.bandcamp.com/album/awakened-by-decay">Awakened by Decay</a> </em>and available on vinyl and digitally<em>.</em> This was interesting news, and I approached it with high hopes.</p>
<p>First impression: the minor shadows have become pools of darkness. The cover art is darker. The title leaves me wondering whether it alludes to fading musical notes or to awareness of the approaching end of life. The track titles circle around dark expanses, separations, absences. And yes, the music too is darker in hue, though without letting go of an underlying warmth carried by the silkily melodic phrases. It feels dark but not too bleak, like dark chocolate. The sense of profound patience and taut restraint is still there, there is still the atmospheric, almost hypnotic meditation on a few select notes. Yet where the earlier material often sounds to me like the attenuated air of wild open spaces, the new album, while firmly in the vein of the earlier material, feels more claustrophobic. The drones that accompany the plaintive guitar meditations are a touch heavier and more insistent, creating a tense undercurrent that tugs at the fragments of melody from beneath.</p>
<p>A comparison that comes to mind is late-period Labradford (that’s a huge compliment, by the way). The palette is sparse: a plangent guitar mutters phrases to itself, drones fill the air around it with a brooding mist, occasional languid percussion and piano add mesmerizing forward motion, a couple of snatches of spoken text drift by. The tracks are held together not so much by melody or dramatic arc as by the sheer tautness of the atmosphere in which they lazily swim. At some points I wonder if this is not so much music characterized by moodiness as moodiness distilled into aural form. It is music that asks a fair bit of the listener, calling for a contemplative patience, a willingness to languish in the slowly unfurling sounds, absorbed in the slowly swaying motion of the journey rather than expecting to be dazzled by any sudden landmarks along the way. A key test for this kind of thing is whether it can maintain the tension, avoid breaking the spell. It does not quite manage that equally strongly across the whole album to my ear—I have my favorite tracks—but there is a remarkable consistency of tone, with enough variety to hold my attention and nudge me onward. You won’t be humming it any time afterwards, but you might just get drawn into its rich, thick textures and meditative lyricism, and if you do, you’ll be glad you went along for the ride. Here&#8217;s hoping it&#8217;s not 13 years until the next installment.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here is my top 20 music releases for 2015, with no claim that they are somehow objectively the best or that I listened to everything anyone else did. I have found things that delighted me on other people’s lists, and the point of the exercise is not to replicate or compete with those lists but to highlight some things you may not have found, things that might delight you. The sequence changed every time I made a shortlist, so take the numbers with a pinch of salt – all of them could be at least plus or minus 5 on a given day.<span id="more-5218"></span></p>
<p><img class="alignleft wp-image-5195" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/review-inscriptions-by-wil-bolton/Inscriptions-150x150.jpg" alt="Inscriptions" width="200" height="200" srcset="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/review-inscriptions-by-wil-bolton/Inscriptions-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/review-inscriptions-by-wil-bolton/Inscriptions.jpg 280w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>#1.</strong> <strong>Wil Bolton – Inscriptions</strong><br />
I have loved many of Wil Bolton’s releases, and this one was especially captivating, a cohesive suite of carefully textured ambient soundscapes of great warmth and delicacy. A delight for the ears from start to finish. Full review <a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//2015/12/review-inscriptions-by-wil-bolton/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5234" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Nils-Frahm-150x150.jpg" alt="Nils Frahm" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Nils-Frahm-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Nils-Frahm-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Nils-Frahm.jpg 512w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>#2. Nils Frahm – Solo</strong><br />
Nils Frahm has had a prolific year, including a film score and electronic duets with Ólafur Arnalds, but where he remains unrivaled is as a painter of fragile intimacy on the piano. This collection of solo piano pieces did not disappoint, offering both slow affection and rhythmic drive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5233" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Kari-Ikonen-150x150.jpg" alt="Kari Ikonen" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Kari-Ikonen-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Kari-Ikonen.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>#<strong>3. Kari Ikonen Trio &#8211; Beauteous Tales and Offbeat Stories</strong><br />
From scampering piano romps to meditative arco bass passages, from stately melodies to discordant experimental interludes, this album charms with its variety and adds another thread to my fondness for Scandinavian piano jazz.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5229" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Hatami-mcclure-150x150.jpg" alt="Hatami mcclure" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Hatami-mcclure-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Hatami-mcclure.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" />#4. Porya Hatami and Darren Mcclure – In-Between Spaces</strong><br />
A delicious marriage of McClure’s abstract tones and Hatami’s gently burbling textures, this joint essay in textured ambiance is gently reflective in mood, a continual, fragile, questing movement within a basic rest. Another excellent release for Hatami, and a fine companion to McClure’s excellent Primary Locations from earlier in the year.</p>

Den Sorte Skole – Indians and Cowboys</strong><br />
Den Sorte Skole take thousands of small samples from old vinyl records and weave them into eclectic tapestries in which they become a cohesive, dappled, new whole. An unerring sense of groove is married to sounds and voices from the past and around the world. Get it for free at the artists’ site <a href="http://densorteskole.net/">here</a>.</p>

Esmerine &#8211; Lost Voices</strong><br />
Marimba, percussion and strings are the backbone of Esmerine’s moody miniatures. The music sometimes shares the ponderous majesty of related bands godspeed you! black emperor and Thee Silver Mt. Zion, but its idiom is more acoustic, rooted in marimba, strings and drums. Lost Voices builds gentle rhythms, passages of lyrical beauty, and outbreaks of restrained melodic intensity into a wistful and dramatic whole, arguably their best yet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5226" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Emily-Hall-150x150.jpg" alt="Emily Hall" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Emily-Hall-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Emily-Hall-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Emily-Hall-768x768.jpg 768w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Emily-Hall-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Emily-Hall.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" />#7. Emily Hall – Folie à Deux</strong><br />
Ostensibly an opera about shared delusion and receiving cosmic messages from an electricity pylon, this charming release sounds more like ambient than opera. Pure, melodic voices meditate dreamily on madness and our relationship to each other and the world that speaks through our electric technologies to the accompaniment of electronic textures, creating a mesmerizing and delightful sound.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5232" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Kangding-Ray-150x150.jpeg" alt="Kangding Ray" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Kangding-Ray-150x150.jpeg 150w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Kangding-Ray-300x300.jpeg 300w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Kangding-Ray.jpeg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" />#8. Kangding Ray – Cory Arcane</strong><br />
I expected this year’s blockbuster from the raster-noton label to be Alva Noto’s Xerrox 3 (which I liked, but am still growing to love), but in the short term at least was more impacted by Kangding Ray’s uneasily skittering techno. Intricate rhythms shift and collide, accompanied by a narrative about the decay of consumerist technological society yet carrying a visceral appeal as pure sound.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5222" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Autistici-150x150.jpg" alt="Autistici" width="150" height="150" />#9. Autistici – Temporal Enhancement</strong><br />
Abstract in concept (an exploration of our perception of sound in its relation to time) and in execution (a focus on sounds themselves and their tensions with one another), this album nevertheless also manages to cohere as a compelling and finely wrought listening experience. The second entry on this list from the Dronarivm label, which had a fine year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5224" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Dag-Rosenqvist-150x150.jpg" alt="Dag Rosenqvist" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Dag-Rosenqvist-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Dag-Rosenqvist-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Dag-Rosenqvist-768x768.jpg 768w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Dag-Rosenqvist-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Dag-Rosenqvist.jpg 1181w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" />#10. Dag Rosenqvist – The Forest Diaries</strong><br />
Rosenqvist had a busy year, but charmed me most with this disarmingly simple set of piano/organ meditations that combine stillness with an undercurrent of dissonance. Notes are allowed to linger and decay, giving time to absorb and reflect. Music for a thoughtful evening.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5241" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Deupree-150x150.jpg" alt="Deupree" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Deupree-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Deupree-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Deupree.jpg 590w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" />#11. Taylor Deupree and Marcus Fischer – Twine</strong><br />
Another serving of the distinctive kind of microscopic beauty that Deupree’s 12k label has been honing for many years now. Gently hissing tape loops undulate their way softly through time, sparsely dusted with gentle chimes and wobbles, seeping softly into the future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>#12. En – City of Brides</strong><br />
En’s follow up to the excellent Already Gone uses their distinctive palette to good effect. Passages of calmly undulating drones sit in tension with densely layered flurries of sound that reach for a cascading majesty, all heard through a dreamy, blurring filter. A distinctive world to get lost in. Full review<a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//2015/12/review-city-of-brides-by-en/"> here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>#13 Seckou Keita &#8211; 22 Strings</strong></p>
<p>This album offers elegant, and life-affirming instrumentals by a master kora-player from Senegal, a few of them accompanied by gentle vocals. African and Western sensibilities interweave in the compositions, and the sound is delicate and warmly inviting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>#14 Goldmund &#8211; Sometimes</strong></p>
<p>Another entry in the atmospheric piano miniatures genre, this deeply melodic and contemplative album combines the gentle piano gestures with light electronic washes to create a beautiful sonic landscape that invites introspection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Port St. Willow – Syncope</strong><br />
The instrumentation here is sparse and restrained, the falsetto vocal plaintive. Patient percussion, punctuating flutters of guitar and electronics, and the undulating melodies create an atmosphere that reminds me of late-period, post-pop Talk Talk.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Ian William Craig – Cradle for the Wanting</strong><br />
Ian William Craig has spent several albums doggedly refining an unusual recipe – ambient compositions based on varying kinds of manipulation of his trained tenor voice. Cradle for the Wanting is perhaps the purest installment yet, the haunting, wordless vocals dancing with their own sonic decay.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5223" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Chris-Bissonnette-150x150.jpg" alt="Chris Bissonnette" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Chris-Bissonnette-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Chris-Bissonnette-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Chris-Bissonnette.jpg 745w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" />#17. Christopher Bissonnette &#8211; Pitch, Paper &amp; Foil</strong><br />
Very much in continuity with last year’s Essays in Idleness, this album continues Bissonnette’s move away from his earlier ambient palette and into his engagement with quavering synth soliloquies. I am left feeling as if it is less a matter of playing music on the synth and more of coaxing the synth into speech, drawing forth a fragile voice from it that sings in its own expressive tongue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5231" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Irisarri-150x150.jpg" alt="Irisarri" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Irisarri-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Irisarri.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" />#18. Rafael Anton Irisarri &#8211; A Fragile Geography</strong><br />
Irisarri’s work is consistently worth listening to, and here as always he achieves a depth of texture and grandness of gesture that lend tremendous weight and presence to his dronescapes. Another important release to add to his growing oeuvre.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5221" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Alva-Noto-150x150.jpg" alt="Alva Noto" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Alva-Noto-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Alva-Noto-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Alva-Noto.jpg 583w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" />#19. Alva Noto &#8211; Xerrox Vol 3</strong><br />
Xerrox Vol 2 is an album that I admire greatly, and there was a 6-year wait for its successor; I think my ears were therefore too primed for something similar. Xerrox 3 is more sparse and subdued and yet also more overtly emotive. Like all of Carsten Nicolai’s work it exudes precision and care. I suspect it will continue to grow on me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5239" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Vivaldi-150x150.jpg" alt="Vivaldi" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Vivaldi-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Vivaldi-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Vivaldi.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" />#20. Fabio Biondi &#8211; Vivaldi: I concerti dell&#8217;addio</strong><br />
I ended up listening to a lot of Vivaldi this year after learning that his music didn’t have to be played like the Vivaldi I grew up hearing. Fabio Biondi’s versions of Vivaldi are always vibrant, and this new collection has rich texture and the accustomed verve.</p>

<p>Norwegian Jenny Hval makes experimental music made up of gentle, often ethereal, synths and uncompromising lyrics focusing on sex, gender, aging, religion, and other deep personal subjects (the word &#8220;cunt&#8221; is startlingly used on multiple tracks).  This combination of the otherworldly and fully human creates an unsettling, fascinating whole.  <em>Apocalypse, girl</em>, Hval&#8217;s third release under her own name, she previously recorded as Rockettothesky and along with Håvard Volden as Nude on Sand, is her best work to date.  In fact, much of <em>Apocalypse, girl</em> merges all the above topics into one massive exploration of the female condition.  This is not music for idle listening, but requires time and focus.  That time and focus are rewarded, however, with one of the most lyrically interesting albums of the year thus far.<span id="more-5132"></span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-june-9-2015/No-Joy-More-Faithful.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5135" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-june-9-2015/No-Joy-More-Faithful.jpg" alt="No Joy - More Faithful" width="280" height="280" srcset="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-june-9-2015/No-Joy-More-Faithful.jpg 280w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-june-9-2015/No-Joy-More-Faithful-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 280px) 100vw, 280px" /></a><strong>No Joy &#8211; <em>More Faithful</em></strong></p>
<p>Fans of everyone from My Bloody Valentine to Beach House to Vivian Girls will find a lot to love in No Joy&#8217;s shoegazey, noise pop sounds.  Based in Montreal, although band member Jasamine White-Gluz relocated there from LA when the band formed, <em>More Faithful</em> is No Joy&#8217;s third full length, and expands the band&#8217;s sound through increased instrumentation, but otherwise maintains its dreamy feel.  Ordinarily, shoegaze is a genre requiring a dark, brooding atmosphere to fully appreciate the music.  No Joy, however, allow enough light into their guitars and vocals that <em>More Faithful</em> is a perfect accompaniment for a summer&#8217;s evening.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-june-9-2015/FFS-FFS.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5133" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-june-9-2015/FFS-FFS.jpg" alt="FFS - FFS" width="280" height="280" srcset="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-june-9-2015/FFS-FFS.jpg 280w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-june-9-2015/FFS-FFS-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 280px) 100vw, 280px" /></a><strong>FFS &#8211; <em>FFS</em></strong></p>
<p>A collaboration between Scottish indie rockers Franz Ferdinand and California new wave pop band Sparks is not something the world would ever expect.  Yet &#8220;Piss Off&#8221; dates all the way back to 2004 when Sparks sent the track to Franz Ferdinand and the bands started talking about working together.  Nothing further happened until recently, however, but now FFS is a real band with a self titled album made up of dancey post punk that doesn&#8217;t wow the listener with artistry, but is damn fun.  In fact, when the album is a true collaboration, <em>FFS</em> feels a lot like a Hot Chip album (if Hot Chip replaced most of their synths with guitars and Alexis Taylor sung in a deeper voice, but still).  At times, however, <em>FFS</em> is more Franz Ferdinand than FFS (interestingly one of these times is on &#8220;Collaborations Don&#8217;t Work&#8221;), and those tracks are much less interesting.</p>

<p>Swede Kristian Matsson has been making singer/songwriter folk as The Tallest Man on Earth since 2006, but <em>Dark Bird is Home</em> is easily his grandest.  Featuring a full band for the first time, including horns and even some electronics, Matsson has added a richness and depth to his music that often puts the album more in the vein of The Decemberists than his usual comparison of Bon Iver.  His true strength, however, remains as a poet, and the album is chock full of wordplay like &#8220;And I&#8217;ve already grown up here, here I might as well grow down&#8221; (from &#8220;Little Nowhere Towns&#8221;).  This combination of orchestration and lyrics makes <em>Dark Bird is Home</em> an absolute gem.<span id="more-5002"></span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-may-12-2015/Blanck-Mass-Dumb-Flesh.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5005" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-may-12-2015/Blanck-Mass-Dumb-Flesh.jpg" alt="Blanck Mass - Dumb Flesh" width="280" height="280" srcset="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-may-12-2015/Blanck-Mass-Dumb-Flesh.jpg 280w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-may-12-2015/Blanck-Mass-Dumb-Flesh-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 280px) 100vw, 280px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Blanck Mass &#8211; <em>Dumb Flesh</em></strong></p>
<p>A side project of Fuck Buttons&#8217; Benjamin John Power, Blanck Mass makes electronic post rock/drone that is more abstract than Power&#8217;s main group, but fans of Fuck Buttons will continue to find a lot to love on Blanck Mass&#8217; second release.  The album is largely made up of heavy drum machine, synth drones, and electronic chirps and flourishes, with label Sacred Bones <a href="http://www.sacredbonesrecords.com/products/sbr136-blanck-mass-dumb-flesh" target="_blank">describing it</a> as &#8220;a comment on the flaws of the human form in its current evolutionary state.&#8221; That&#8217;s an awful lot to glean from 53 minutes of instrumental experiments, but <em>Dumb Flesh</em> is nonetheless a seriously enjoyable listen even if its meaning is elusive.</p>

<p>Tacky, trashy, and scuzzy, Guantanamo Baywatch make surf, garage rock inspired by bands like The Trashmen, The Sonics, and The Cramps, and does so for one reason only: It&#8217;s fun.  <em>Darling&#8230;It&#8217;s Too Late</em> is the trio&#8217;s second widely available full length (although there are earlier recordings out there), and takes an &#8220;if it ain&#8217;t broke, don&#8217;t fix it&#8221; mentality to the group&#8217;s formula.  There&#8217;s reverb and lots of tenor on the guitars, vocal harmonies, and a rawness to the music that makes <em>Darling&#8230;It&#8217;s Too Late</em> perfect for hanging out on a summer&#8217;s day.</p>

<p>If there were questions as to the direction Sufjan Stevens would take after the departure from the norm that was <em>Age of Adz</em>, naming his new album after his mother and stepfather (his first album since his mother&#8217;s passing, mind you) answered those questions load and clear: Sufjan Stevens is looking back, which means a return to lovely, gentle indie folk.  <em>Carrie &amp; Lowell</em> strips away both the electronics of <em>Adz</em> and the lush orchestration of <em>Come on Feel the Illinoise</em>, putting the focus squarely on Sufjan&#8217;s lyrics, which come heavily from his life.  This album is going inspire a lot of reminiscing, particularly amongst those who have lost parents, and is going to cause a lot of tears.  They&#8217;ll be happy tears, though, so it&#8217;s unlikely people will be complaining. <span id="more-4962"></span></p>

Black Emperor &#8211; <em>Asunder, Sweet and Other Distress</em></strong></p>
<p>Somewhere along the way, Godspeed You! Black Emperor&#8217;s post rock dropped its found sounds and more lighthearted moments, veering strongly to the drone end of the genre&#8217;s spectrum.  <em>Asunder, Sweet and Other Distress</em> continues the band&#8217;s exploration of that side of post rock.  The album is throbbing, foreboding, and everything you expect from GY!BE, but there is a surprising amount of light in these drones.  This is not an album that pummels you into submission through builds to overwhelming climaxes, rather it invites the listener to immerse themselves in the quieter moments with an almost hopeful feel that leaves the listener feeling legitimately joyful.</p>

<p>Baltimore&#8217;s Lower Dens are a band on the rise.  In 2012 they released the excellent <em>Nootropics</em>, an album heavily indebted to shoegaze/dream pop sounds that would have fit in well on 4AD.  With <em>Escape From Evil</em>, however, they&#8217;re introducing a dancey, new wave feel to their music.  Drums and bass drive the songs on <em>Escape From Evil</em> and give the album a bounce that just hasn&#8217;t existed for the band before. Even with the new direction, however, the band&#8217;s music rises and falls with Jana Hunter&#8217;s strong alto vocals (reminiscent of Baltimore cohort Victoria Legrand of Beach House), and on this album there is far more rise than fall.</p>

<p><em>This is the second and concluding part of an interview with Jayne Amara Ross and Frédéric D. Oberland of the Parisian band FareWell Poetry. Read the first part <a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//2012/04/interview-farewell-poetry/" title="Interview: FareWell Poetry (Part 1)">here</a>.</em></p>
<p><strong>Jayne, are there any moments in the album where the shape the music has taken added something to your sense of the poetry you had written?</strong></p>
<p>Yes definitely, we try to create pieces where each individual element (the poetry, the music, the films) stand alone but work as a whole also. When we have done a good, thorough job every element should enrich the other. It is only when all the mediums align behind the same very precise objective that you get that feeling of something whole, and enveloping. I wouldn’t, however, rely on the music to give meaning to the poetry or the films. Music is able to sublimate and carry meaning but not to impose it. At its best, it can be the wondrous, intoxicating glue that holds everything together. In all my films, including those that I have made outside FareWell Poetry, music is a really important part and I have always shared a privileged dialogue with the musicians that I have worked with. You can also go really wrong when you add music to film, you can easily trip yourself up by making the wrong choices. Having a close relationship with the composer, and learning to communicate in their ‘language’ can help prevent this.</p>
<p><strong><span id="more-2719"></span>Frédéric, are there ways in which the poetry and film drew the musicians in directions they might not have taken otherwise?</strong></p>
<p>Certainly, there is an evident and necessary connection between the three media used in FareWell Poetry &#8211; poetry, film, music. This interaction is especially clear when we are working on the music for our films/performances like &#8216;As True As Troilus&#8217; (on our first album) or &#8216;The Golden House: For Him I Sought the Woods&#8217; and &#8216;Persephone, A Soft Corpse Comfort&#8217; (on the next). In those cases, Jayne gives us the film&#8217;s scenario to read, written by her before the filming even begins, a scenario that often resembles a poetic text more than a classic film outline, already provided with quite strong mental images, a description of of what is happening in the image, director&#8217;s notes, the &#8220;voice-off&#8221;/narration, etc. We also have an idea of the film format, the duration, whether the film will be in B&amp;W or in color, etc. This first text serves as a guide for the music, a kind of visual and spiritual score, and then among the musicians we improvise, experiment, search for themes and tones, uncover a structure adequate to fit the ideas of the scenario and the different parts and atmospheres of the film. This is the confrontation phase, always passionate; on the one hand the already-written story (often long-cherished by Jayne) and on the other the unleashing of a musical instinct that can veer off in all respects. When we get the first rushes we make selections together from these first musical attempts, we compare everything precisely with the mounted sequences and the spoken poetry, we fix and write down what seems to fit. And we refine the whole as we go along and over the course of rehearsals and performances.</p>
<p>When there is not a film in play, the interaction between poetry and music is not so defined, or at least not as consciously. Of course, the poetry necessarily feeds the music. In Jayne&#8217;s poetry there are often strong metaphors and images that give us broad overall ideas for a piece, or quite specific ones &#8211; the wish for a certain sound, timbre, or rhythm to underline a particular word or poetic image. But I think that belongs to every good song&#8230; Conversely, I think that certain aspects of our music, the colors, the moods, the mental images that it conveys, are also a source of inspiration for Jayne&#8217;s work.</p>
<div id="attachment_2770" style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class=" wp-image-2770" title="8651799_orig" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/interview-farewell-poetry-part-2/8651799_orig-300x168.jpg" alt="" width="590" height="330" srcset="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/interview-farewell-poetry-part-2/8651799_orig-300x168.jpg 300w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/interview-farewell-poetry-part-2/8651799_orig-1024x575.jpg 1024w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/interview-farewell-poetry-part-2/8651799_orig.jpg 1100w" sizes="(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">From: The Golden House: For Him I Sought The Woods</p></div>
<p><strong>It sounds as if fans of </strong><em><strong>Hoping for the Invisible to Ignite</strong></em><strong> can expect a similar constellation of poetry, film, and music with the next album. Is that right? Are there new directions in the themes or music?</strong></p>
<p><em>Jayne:</em> The next &#8216;big&#8217; film (akin to &#8216;As True As Troilus&#8217; on <em>Hoping For the Invisible to Ignite</em>) will be &#8216;The Golden House: For Him I Sought the Woods&#8217; which I shot last Spring and we began performing the soundtrack live last Summer. When it comes to the films and poetry, the direction or themes are imposed by the content of each piece and then I will try to find a literary coherence that will hold everything together. We would like to make a double album, because we have the material (at least an hour and a half of music and two films) and because we would like to be able to take the time to produce a more intricate offering. &#8216;Hoping for the Invisible to Ignite&#8217; has a sort of simplicity in that everything is expressed in quite a bold, straightforward dichotomy. The next album will be more varied. We would also like to include my film &#8216;Persephone, A Soft Corpse Comfort&#8217; on the album and other spoken word/instrumental pieces that we regularly play onstage and that have a more experimental or modern classical feel to them. The &#8216;post-rock&#8217; appellation only really fits the first album and we will be really happy to get rid of this label!</p>
<p><em>Frédéric: </em>We wanted our first album to have the flavor of a &#8220;manifesto&#8221;, we wanted it to be compact, immediate, flamboyant, to reflect our work and our wishes, without ever thinking about the reception that it might have, about the affiliations or currents to which people might attach us. Even in the studio, we tend to work with our heart more than our intellect. The same constitutive elements will be found in the next album &#8211; music, film, and poetry &#8211; but no doubt interweaving in a different way, perhaps more varied in terms of colors, atmospheres, durations, instruments. There is still a great deal of work and experimenting to be done, even if the majority of the new pieces are in place and certain of them are being tested regularly on stage. We are proceeding a step at a time in terms of the practicalities involved for us in realizing an album &#8211; we usually record the basis of our pieces in quasi-live conditions, but we like to stand back then afterwards to choose the takes, set the arrangements, and mix. The studio is a crucial and delicate phase for us, it&#8217;s not always easy to find the ideal balance between the rigor of the recording process and the spontaneous and fragile side of the alchemy that we are seeking among us and among the various elements that make up our pieces&#8230; The magic, when it&#8217;s there, is never at our beck and call. We will no doubt record in several sessions starting in late spring or early summer; there will be others invited in, friends, and we hope to be surprised and pleased by the result. One must still have chaos within oneself to give birth to a dancing star&#8230;</p>

<p>In the closing months of 2011, a new band from Paris called <a title="FareWell Poetry" href="http://www.farewell-poetry.com/home.html" target="_blank">FareWell Poetry</a> leapt from obscurity to a prominent place on various best-of-2011 lists, thanks to their arresting debut album <em>Hoping for the Invisible to Ignite</em>. (Read a review and stream the music <a title="Vital Albums: Hoping for the Invisible to Ignite" href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//2012/01/vital-albums-hoping-for-the-invisible-to-ignite/" target="_blank">here</a>). Weaving together spoken word, a literary narrative backdrop, film, and compelling, slow-burning instrumental soundscapes, the album combined a high-art conceptual seriousness with an accessible musical appeal. It evidenced a capacity to delight and move and fascinate while appealing to the intellect as well as the gut, allowing the listener to be carried away by the guitar crescendos or ponder the poetic allusions or both at once.  Jayne Amara Ross composed and performed the poetry and directed the accompanying film. Frédéric D. Oberland (whose recent collaboration with Richard Knox, <a title="The Rustle of the Stars" href="http://www.therustleofthestars.com/" target="_blank">The Rustle of the Stars</a>, is also excellent), contributes guitar, fender rhodes, piano, harmonium, soundscapes. Stéphane Pigneul on bass, Eat Gas on guitar, Stanislas Grimbert on drums, and Colin JohnCo providing analog electronics complete the line-up. Jayne and Frédéric kindly agreed to talk to us about how the debut album came about, about the band&#8217;s creative process, and about plans for the next release.</p>
<p><strong><span id="more-1883"></span>FareWell Poetry seem to have skipped the common route of a couple of promising-sounding EPs and a local following and gone straight into contention for 2011 album of the year. Tell us a little about how the project came about and why you think it turned out so good so quickly.</strong></p>
<p>Jayne : FareWell Poetry came into being when Frédéric was commissioned to create a performance for a Parisian experimental music event in 2009. He asked me and Jeff (aka Eat Gas) to join him and the three of us created ‘As True As Troilus’. I had been working on the mythology of Troilus and Cressida for two years and had a lot of material (on film and in writing) but it wasn’t until this collaborative effort that I felt able to chisel a coherent piece out of the amorphous mass. One performance led to another and, in order to create a richer sound, Frédéric and Jeff called on musicians that they liked and admired, inviting Stanislas Grimbert, Colin JohnCo and later Stéphane Pigneul to join us. ‘FareWell Poetry’ is not a just a reference to the literary aspect of the project, it also refers to the music and the films: the musicality of the poetry, the filmic quality of the music, the cadence and deliberate rhythms of the films… we were (and still are) aiming to create a powerful whole, a tightly coiled skein.</p>
<p>Frédéric: ‘Hoping For the Invisible to Ignite’ was created in two very separate recording sessions. Initially we were actually thinking of releasing an EP and we went into the studio and recorded 3 tracks, only one of which survived (All in the full, indomitable light of HOPE). I think that we were a little green going into the studio for that first session, we still had a lot to learn, about what we wanted and what we didn’t. When we went back to record ‘As True As Troilus’ over a year later, everything seemed really simple, as if the tracks had come fully into themselves, as if we had come fully into ourselves as a band.</p>
<p>Jayne: We wanted our first release to be a sort of manifesto: introducing the narrator of all the poems (that are all written in the first person) as someone who wants to communicate with the listener, enter into some sort of communion and the notion of hope as an access to higher things. Basically, its our shared feeling that it is easy to be blasé in this day and age, to feel hardened against life and love because of the violence and the superficiality that surrounds us. Having hope and believing in beauty is harder but we still think that it’s worth it. This perhaps explains the bold (or even blunt) nature of this first record. Reality may be really bleak but we are still hoping for the invisible to ignite.</p>
<p>Frédéric: Receiving nice reviews is really encouraging but we are still a young band. I think that we were all surprised to see people turn up at our gigs despite the unusual format. Often when you say ‘poetry’, ‘drone’ or ‘experimental film’ people take fright! Perhaps something in our unabashed desire to communicate emotionally with the audience allowed us to lure the reticent and the curious into our performances (well&#8230;that’s what we like to think!). We have quite a loyal following in Paris and have performed a little in the UK with our label mates but that’s it, so in many ways we remain quite local. Hopefully 2012 will come with some opportunities to travel, meet new audiences.</p>

<p><strong>Pulling people in for something that is ‘poetry’, ‘drone’, AND ‘experimental film’, and creating as much dramatic tension as you do with those elements, certainly seems an achievement! Having the music, the film and the poetry together opens up a very rich space for interpretation. You’ve talked elsewhere about using Troilus and Cressida to provide a mythology in which to explore your own loves and hurts – it seems likely that listeners will follow suit with your poems. <strong>Is it important to you that listeners get the authorial intentions behind the poetry? </strong>Are you content for listeners to explore their own readings, or are there some things in there you really want us to notice and get right?</strong></p>
<p>Jayne : That&#8217;s a ‘yes’ and ‘yes’ question! I like the idea of mythology as a language that allows one to communicate a very personal experience without being hindered by superficial specifics like, for example, the specific details of circumstance or a specific time frame. Once you set things in Troy 3000 years ago and involve characters with names like Diomedes and Cressida, no one is worried about relating to the story on a ‘well-that’s-just-like-my-everyday’ level anymore. Hopefully this allows for the listener/audience to open up on a more emotional level, making the story their own. It is also more comfortable for the poet/narrator to use an allegory to relate all these terribly intimate things. Personally I find that it allows me to be more truthful, or truthful in a deeper way and at the same time retain my own dignity and privacy.</p>
<p>Although I enjoy the thought that each person has a different reading, the poetry (as well as the films, which are visual poems for me) is designed to reflect meaning with a certain clarity. I do not believe in random association (which is very different from free association) and there is nothing experimental about the format of the poems. I don’t think that anything in my poetry is obtuse, or at least it is not intended to be so. I have read a few confused interpretations but mainly from people who are more familiar with writing about music and perhaps feel a little uneasy about talking about the rest. The few in depth reviews of my work by film critics have been spot on, or in keeping with what I feel I have put into the poetry/films. Though even as I say that I am aware that this is a gross generalization and that it is too early to see a pattern emerge.</p>
<p>But yes, there is a very definite narrative behind the poetry/films and if the listener/critic has read things thoroughly and some things still remain opaque, then that’s my fault for not being dextrous enough.</p>
<div id="attachment_2773" style="width: 460px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2773" title="5532834_orig" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/interview-farewell-poetry/5532834_orig-300x168.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="256" /><p class="wp-caption-text">From: As True as Troilus</p></div>
<p><strong>Would you be willing to choose a line or image that was particularly resonant for you and unpack it a little for us?</strong></p>
<p>From ‘As True As Troilus’ : ‘In the small font of a footnote, I beg for the tight screw, the green light, the hungry flutter of white hands at the blackening keys, to hammer out my own truth, weave a sharp confession, my knuckles chiming over the launch pad like church bells.’</p>
<p>This part of &#8216;As True As Troilus&#8217; is me talking about the process of writing and the feeling that I could be writing more, and better. I try to write every day and be very disciplined about it. I feel like a runner who has difficulty beginning but then revels in the moment when the body takes over the basic movements and the mind takes flight. I believe that writing is an art of endurance and the best things (the deeper analogies, the wildest similes) often come after two/three/four hours of writing complete drivel. Somehow these comments on how well I think I’m writing and how much I want to take flight always creep into the poetry.</p>
<p>More specifically: The ‘green light’ is a sort of internal laissez-passer, the ‘tight screw’ is discipline, ‘the hungry flutter of white hands at the blackening keys’ is the way I feel when the writing is going well, as if my whole body is participating the choreography (and the hours of fluttering over the white keys of my little macbook make them a dirty but glorious black!). &#8216;In the small font of a footnote&#8217; is an attempt, like the &#8216;in jest&#8217; at the end of the poem to be self-deprecating. The narrator is aware that she is being very raw and very melodramatic all through this and clumsily drops these &#8216;I don&#8217;t really care that much/Its not so bad&#8217; comments that are quite obviously fake.</p>
<p>Then ‘weave a sharp confession’ takes us back to the hands weaving in the film and the tale of Philomela (an excerpt of Ovid’s telling of this tale opens the film). Philomela was raped by her brother in law Tereus. After raping her Tereus cut her tongue out in order to prevent her from telling her sister. Unable to communicate orally, Philomela decides to tell her story on a tapestry that she weaves by hand, depicting the violent act committed against her. The hands that you see in the film are the narrator’s, weaving a series of tableaus of a mythology that is not her own but still serves to communicate the essence of her plight. I also feel very close to Philomela who, when words fail her, turns to another means of expression in order to impart her tragedy. This, to me, seems to justify all creative impulses. The longing to communicate is the impetus and then the choice of an appropriate and possible medium comes next.</p>
<p>‘My knuckles chiming over the launch pad like church bells’ is a celebration of the feeling you get when the words are flowing easily, that sort of ecstatic joy, a feeling that all your disparate parts are finally pulling together to create a perfect whole.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here as elsewhere, 2011 finished with the customary best-of-year lists, inevitably confronting the dedicated music lover with large numbers of as yet unpurchased albums said to be the cream of the crop; catching up would cost a small fortune, even if 2012 held no new promises. Well, 2011 also saw the release of some excellent albums offered for free download, and a few of the Metelaifne Music authors have put together a list of their favorites across several genres. All of the albums listed below can be downloaded either for free or on a &#8220;name your own price&#8221; basis (donations encouraged, but with no minimum) from the artists or labels or at bandcamp. You can also stream some of them below. Our thanks to these artists for making such good music freely available.<span id="more-1055"></span></p>
<p><img class="alignleft" title="Recollage" src="http://luxusarctica.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/luxxar052001-01_front.jpg?w=300&amp;h=300" alt="" width="250" height="250" /></p>
<p><a title="Recollage" href="http://luxusarctica.wordpress.com/2011/01/17/recollage/" target="_blank">Recollage</a> by Erik Nilsson is a strong contender for best free release of the year. Nilsson brings together a variety of acoustic instrumemts (guitar, piano, glockenspiel) and field recordings (clocks appear more than once), slices and splices them, sets them in complex constellations, and crafts a result that is much more melodic and accessible that that process might sound. From the lively guitar-based opener (somewhat reminiscent of some moments on Oval&#8217;s O) through more languid and folksy moments to the twangily experimental closing track, Nilsson maintains an overall intimate warmth and an appealing tunefulness amid the folktronica stutters. Each track comes across as a small story; as the album progresses you&#8217;ll find yourself listening in fascination for the next well-placed sound effect, the next rickety snatch of melody. Highly recommended. Download it for free from <a title="Recollage" href="http://luxusarctica.wordpress.com/2011/01/17/recollage/" target="_blank">Luxus-Arctica Records.</a></p>
<p><img class="alignright" title="Benjamin Dauer - Saturation Event" src="http://26.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lmtzn2jwee1qf91zfo1_500.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="250" /></p>
<p>Following on from his debut album, <em>Burning of Wine</em>, Benjamin Dauer released <em><a title="Saturation Event" href="http://feedbacklooplabel.blogspot.com/2011/06/fbl015-benjamin-dauer-saturation-event.html" target="_blank">Saturation Event</a></em> on the <a title="feedbackloop" href="http://feedbacklooplabel.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">feedbackloop netlabel</a>, an album <a title="Dauer comments" href="http://www.benjamindauer.net/music.php" target="_blank">described by Dauer</a> as &#8221; a sonic exploration of the place that exists between being awake and asleep.&#8221; Dauer continues: &#8220;I wanted to capture some of the feeling, that haze or cloud, that descends upon your mind just before letting go and drifting off.&#8221; You could certainly do worse than drift off to this, but it also more than repays an attentive listen at higher volume. Fluctuating between light and dark textures, the album sustains a sense of spacious tension, blurred edges, lush tones, and constantly shifting beauty. The textures are rich and complex, and decent headphones are recommended. Download it for free <a title="Saturation Event" href="http://feedbacklooplabel.blogspot.com/2011/06/fbl015-benjamin-dauer-saturation-event.html" target="_blank">here</a>.<br />

<p><img class="alignleft" title="Cliff Dweller - Ghosts of the Dust Bowl" src="http://f0.bcbits.com/z/21/47/214775415-1.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="250" /></p>
<p>You could maybe think of this one as Old West ambient post-rock. On <em><a title="Ghosts" href="http://cliffdweller.bandcamp.com/album/ghosts-of-the-dust-bowl" target="_blank">Ghosts of the Dust Bowl</a></em>, <a title="Cliff Dweller home page" href="http://cliffdwellermedia.com/" target="_blank">Cliff Dweller</a> use a mixture of acoustic instruments, atmospherics and found sounds to conjure up an instrumental soundscape that speaks of dilapidated desert towns. The mostly short pieces tell a story of desolation through scraping of violins, plucked strings, percussive clatters, forlorn accordion melodies, and snatches of lost voices and environmental sounds. At times reminiscent of a Godspeed You! Black Emperor side project, the album is experimental but evocative, offering atmospheric music with a strong sense of place and time. You can stream or download the album for free <a title="Ghosts of the Dust Bowl" href="http://cliffdweller.bandcamp.com/album/ghosts-of-the-dust-bowl" target="_blank">at bandcamp</a>, or see a video for one of the tracks <a title="The Warshippers" href="http://vimeo.com/26893128" target="_blank" class="broken_link">on vimeo</a>.<br />
<iframe style="position: relative; display: block; width: 46px; height: 23px;" src="http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/album=1632818826/size=short/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/" frameborder="0" width="46" height="23"></iframe></p>
<p><img class="alignright" title="adamned.age - Fragile" src="http://www.camomillemusic.com/CML007%20-%20Fragile%20by%20A%20damned%20age_thumb.jpg " alt="" width="250" height="250" /></p>
<p>If it weren&#8217;t for the punctuation, the name <a title="adamned.age home page" href="http://www.adamned-age.com/" target="_blank">adamned.age</a> might evoke something angry and punkish, but it is in fact the artist name used by Berlin-based artist Hanne Adam, who trades in delicate ambient surfaces and gently complex beats across which small flurries of sparkling notes skitter prettily. Released on the <a title="Camomille Music" href="http://www.camomillemusic.com/" target="_blank">Camomille netlabel</a>, <em><a title="Fragile" href="http://www.adamned-age.com/highslide%204.1.5/music_releases_net.html" target="_blank" class="broken_link">Fragile</a></em> is a delightful and aptly named collection of immersive, melodic pieces that breathe of patience and care. While most of the tracks have busy rhythms (if a genre designation is needed, IDM would seem to be a reasonable fit), the overall effect is emotive and restful. It&#8217;s a beautiful release, and worth repeated listens. Download it <a title="Fragile" href="http://www.adamned-age.com/highslide%204.1.5/music_releases_net.html" target="_blank" class="broken_link">here</a> (scroll down and click on the album title).<br />

<p><img class="alignleft" title="Years of Rice and Salt - Nothing of Cities" src="http://f0.bcbits.com/z/38/25/3825840336-1.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="250" /></p>
<p>Years of Rice and Salt, a Californian instrumental post-rock outfit, seem to have decided that their take on the genre will involve moving past the catharsis to the afterglow. Their release <em><a title="Nothing of Cities" href="http://futurerecordings.bandcamp.com/album/nothing-of-cities" target="_blank">Nothing of Cities</a></em> on <a title="Future Recordings home page" href="http://futurerecordings.bigcartel.com/" target="_blank">Future Recordings</a> (name your own price at Bandcamp) exudes gentleness and warmth. Melodic throughout, with understated brass and strings added to the guitars and percussion, the album trades in the usual slow builds, moments of power, and pretty phrases, but always stays warm and celebratory, going for tuneful rather than edgy and succeeding. It is listed it here not because it is groundbreaking, but because it is simply enjoyable, music for those moments when all is well with the world and good friends are near. Stream or download <a title="Nothing of Cities" href="http://futurerecordings.bandcamp.com/album/nothing-of-cities" target="_blank">at bandcamp</a>.<br />

<p><img class="alignright" title="Pleasure Center" src="http://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000014302872-bpt3uw-crop.jpg?5d75100" alt="" width="250" height="250" /></p>
<p>On November 21, 2011, singer-songwriter <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessie_Baylin">Jessie Baylin</a> released a free 5-song EP entitled <em><a title="Pleasure Center" href="http://soundcloud.com/jessiebaylin/sets/jessie-baylin-pleasure-center" target="_blank">Pleasure Center</a></em> that’s well worth picking up.  Produced by Richard Swift (The Shins) and recorded in Jessie’s living room on a 4-track cassette, it is a project of covers ranging from Sonic Youth to Fleetwood Mac to Thin Lizzie, very cleverly reworked to conjure up visions of yesteryear’s dreamy pop sound a la Dusty Springfield and transplanted into the 21st century by that characteristic lo-fi Swift sound. This little EP is downright addictive. The more one listens to it, the more infectious it becomes &#8211; especially the standout track, “White Noise.”  Pick up the entire EP totally free for the taking (compliments of Jessie) by clicking on the download buttons below.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//2012/01/best-free-releases-from-2011/maskol/" rel="attachment wp-att-1527"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1527" title="Maskol" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/Maskol-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="240" srcset="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/Maskol-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/Maskol-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/Maskol.jpg 350w" sizes="(max-width: 240px) 100vw, 240px" /></a></p>
<p>Eric Maskol is a transplant from Philadelphia to San Francisco, and as you might expect from a young man from each of those cities, his debut album, <em><a href="http://ericmaskol.bandcamp.com/">The Year Before the War</a></em>, has a strong psychedelic pop vibe.  Interestingly, however, his brand of psych pop bears little resemblance to his hometowns’ current standard bearers in Kurt Vile or Thee Oh Sees.  Instead Maskol is quite obviously influenced by Robyn Hitchcock.  In fact, to the unfamiliar listener, <em>The Year Before the War</em> may well be indistinguishable from Hitchcock.  Such a comparison would be unfair to most artists, but it appears that Maskol has the talent to meet his ambitions and <em>The Year Before the War</em> is a great start.<br />

<p><a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//2012/01/best-free-releases-from-2011/love-culture/" rel="attachment wp-att-1534"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1534" title="Love Culture" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/Love-Culture-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="240" srcset="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/Love-Culture-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/Love-Culture-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/Love-Culture.jpg 350w" sizes="(max-width: 240px) 100vw, 240px" /></a></p>
<p>In a lot of ways 2011 saw the return of the ‘90s, and the Columbus, Ohio five piece Love Culture is right at home in that revival.  The band’s <em><a href="http://lovecultureband.bandcamp.com/">Aquamarine</a></em> EP is chock full of ‘90s shoegaze and guitar rock that instantly transports me back to my teenage years.  One of the more impressive things about the EP, however, is just how good it sounds. The band obviously put a ton of work into mixing and mastering, because it’s the rare DIY noise rock outfit that sounds this sharp and clear.  All the clarity in the world wouldn’t matter, though, if the songs weren’t there, and Love Culture certainly has the songs down pat.<br />

<p>A drone oriented side project from Hooray for Earth&#8217;s Noel Heroux, Dpony’s <em><a href="http://hoorayforearth.net/2011/11/14/dpony-movie/" class="broken_link">Movie</a></em> EP, includes one of the top tracks of the year with &#8220;Lessmi&#8221;.  &#8220;Lessmi&#8221; is the type of track that will knock you off your feet on first listen, but amazingly the rest of <em>Movie</em> lives up to its stand out track.  <em>Movie</em> is dark and heavy and perfect for winter listening, and while not pure drone by any stretch of the imagination it does earn that genre label.  Please don&#8217;t let that scare you away, though, anyone with the slightest interest in experimental music will find something to love here.  Plus, the EP is free, so what do you have to lose? Here&#8217;s a sample:<br />

<p><em><a title="FareWell Poetry" href="http://www.farewell-poetry.com/releases.html">Hoping for the Invisible to Ignite</a></em> by Parisian collective FareWell Poetry is one of the more absorbing musical journeys of 2011. It is also an album that wears its ambition on its sleeve. A Super 8/16mm black and white film on DVD (trailer <a title="Vimeo" href="http://vimeo.com/24995247" target="_blank">here</a>), filled with images of compulsive self-absorption and erotic obsession (warning: nudity), accompanies the 20 minute opening piece, and there&#8217;s also an <a title="iTunes" href="http://itunes.apple.com/app/farewell-poetry-as-true-as/id466413875?mt=8" target="_blank">iPhone app</a> to go alongside both. The lyrics take the form of extravagant spoken-word poetry boasting a lofty lineage:</p>
<blockquote><p>‘As True As Troilus’ takes its title and mythology from Chaucer’s important 14th century poem ‘Troilus and Criseyde’, a retelling of a ‘faux’ Greek myth with Medieval origins, in which the main protagonist Troilus falls in love with Trojan Cressida who finally deceives and leaves him for the Greek soldier Diomedes. The narrator of ‘As True As Troilus’ (just as Chaucer’s narrator) uses this myth to explore his own romantic mythology, using the characters and their situation to recount his own plight, illustrating the destruction of his own failed relationship with tableaux from the Trojan tale.</p></blockquote>
<p>Act 3, Scene 2 of Shakespeare&#8217;s <em>Troilus and Cressida</em>, which portrays the same doomed love affair, also plays a role, and Ovid is cited in the film. Described on the band&#8217;s site as a &#8220;bold and electrifying project,&#8221; we are left in no doubt that this is a work of substance.</p>
<p><span id="more-1213"></span>This much ambition can backfire, and there were on first listen moments when I was left feeling that the earnest cadences were trying a little too hard to assure me that I was listening to Very Deep And Important Poetry. However, the readings grow in power with subsequent listens. Allow yourself to be drawn in and a compelling musical journey awaits. You can stream the album below as you read, courtesy of the band&#8217;s <a title="FareWell Poetry" href="http://www.farewell-poetry.com/" target="_blank">webpage</a>.</p>
<p><iframe src="http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fplaylists%2F1340150&amp;auto_play=false&amp;show_artwork=false&amp;color=000000" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" width="100%" height="340"></iframe></p>
<p>The dominant style is a kind of avant-garde, minimalist post-rock with ambient touches. Add FareWell Poetry to bands such as Kwoon and MØN and it seems as if a chunk of the most interesting post-rock is coming from Paris these days. There are clear affinities with the compositions of Godspeed You! Black Emperor. One thing that set the best GYBE epics apart from the rest of the post-rock fold was the sense of storytelling, a sense created not just from the long arcs of build and release central to the genre, but from the field recordings and spoken word passages that anchored the sweeping sonic landscapes in personal biographies and glimpses of human hopes and fears. These fragile fragments of sonic portraiture were in turn elevated to a widescreen treatment by the expansive instrumental journeys that accompanied them. FareWell Poetry&#8217;s debut release comes closer than anything else I&#8217;ve heard to both carrying forward what was exciting about those GYBE stories-in-sound and adding its own distinctive contribution.</p>
<p>GYBE&#8217;s political edge is absent here; the emphasis is more psychological, even psychoanalytic. The opening track, &#8216;As True as Troilus&#8217;, opens with 14 minutes of emotionally estranged poetic narrative, written and performed by poet/filmmaker Jayne Amara Ross. It is accompanied by a slow, tense burn of guitar groans and ambient sounds. Perhaps referencing the appeal that Shakespeare&#8217;s Troilus makes to conventional lovers&#8217; similes (&#8220;rhymes,/Full of protest, of oath and big compare&#8221;) before parading &#8220;true as Troilus&#8221; as the new standard of faithfulness, the track opens with its own lurid web of similes. They trace the anguish of a passion betrayed by both the other&#8217;s unfaithfulness and one&#8217;s own willing self-deception. The narrator&#8217;s lover has left, and dogged faithfulness turns cold and despairing, &#8220;dwarfed in not knowing why&#8221;. Former hopes now &#8220;suck at my bowels, like mice&#8221;. Dreams of things being different quickly circle back to the inauspicious beginnings of the relationship, its beginnings suggesting both love and possession, both desire and denial. The narrator speaks wistfully of being &#8220;in dreams airlifted out&#8221;, yet the film shows only racing fingers compulsively knotting a fragile rope ladder out of string and matches. As the emotional furies swirl, the music continues to build, and the emerging melody, after tense ebbs and flows, finally erupts in a powerful guitar-led maelstrom.</p>
<p>The second and third tracks are parts 1 and 2 of a second epic, titled &#8216;All in the Full, Indomitable Light of Hope.&#8217; There is little hope to be found in the first part. Barely audible ambient drones and creaking strings create a bleak, windswept effect that drifts into sad melody. The narrator returns in more pensive mode &#8211; the initial storm is exhausted, &#8220;life finds its way back to me,&#8221; and the possibility of hope is painfully raised. Part 2 risks evoking the lazy reviewer comment that &#8220;it&#8217;s been done before by [insert name of post-rock band]&#8221; (ironically itself a tired cliché). It opens with melodious guitar and gentle chimes, then proceeds through gently repeating figures into tremolo passages as percussion builds, and the song climaxes in a glorious swell of hope. The structure is indeed familiar (though gorgeously done), but the interesting thing is not whether we have heard these sounds before, but rather what is being done with them <em>here</em>.</p>
<p>As the guitars die away into more dissonant feedback and scraping strings, the narrator returns with a complex determination, more elegiac than triumphant, to &#8220;dance the old dance in new footwear.&#8221; With hope, however, so also &#8220;darkness finds its way back to me.&#8221; It&#8217;s as if the narrator wishes that life were a conventionally ascending post-rock triumph, but needs to keep hope honest. It is telling that here the spoken word is kept separate from the melodic sections, tied to the bleaker opening and conclusion, as if self and hope are still in conversation. The sweet, soaring hope of the guitars is now more complex, real (&#8220;But I have love!&#8221;), yet precarious. This pair of tracks ends with the couplet &#8220;And there is no one time too many,/And there are no redundant prayers&#8221;. In what is to my ear one of the most effective vocal moments on the album, a modulation of the voice on the final word reframes these lines with a fragile, questioning note, as if saying &#8220;there are no redundant prayers&#8230;are there? Please tell me there aren&#8217;t?&#8221;</p>
<p>The final track, brief but poignant, draws the threads together. The title, &#8216;In Dreams Airlifted Out&#8217;, picks up a line from the earlier lyric, and the melody also is drawn from &#8216;True as Troilus&#8217;. In the first track the narrator had wished &#8220;to be a pianist/and hunger at the keys,&#8221; to &#8220;hammer out my own truth, weave a sharp confession, my knuckles chiming over the launch pad like church bells.&#8221; This closing track opens with a church bell &#8211; not celebratory, but solemnly chiming the hour. The melody appears at first in the naively chiming notes of a music box (hope!), before being picked up by an out-of-tune piano. After a few bars, a floating electronic interlude shifts us to an ethereal dream world, then the piano melody returns, moving into a higher register, but with an accompanying dark, low rumble.</p>
<p>The album thus ends on a marvelously nuanced note, a chastened, cracked, but sweet and real hope still in conversation with pain and despair, struggling to flower out of hurt, still seeking a foundation that might ground the continuing possibility of love. It is a fitting conclusion to a narrative that has wrestled so elementally with whether faithfulness can salvage denial, whether hope can survive betrayal, whether confession can heal, whether prayers are still meaningful, whether there is a way beyond the string-and-matches ladder of one passion tied in series to the next. The album is far more honest than most pop music about the price of careless eros, and as a result the tenuously determined thread of hope reaches for something more than glib optimism.</p>
<p>This review is already long enough to test patience, though there is much more that could be said &#8211; all of it, like the above, just my interpretation of the work. Suffice it to say that this is an important album, indeed a &#8220;bold and electrifying project.&#8221; In terms of emotional and lyrical complexity, this is streets ahead of most other post-rock releases, and the music is carefully and effectively married to the poetry, demanding serious attention and rewarding with articulate depth. Listen with care.</p>
