				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Can it be a year since the last list? Here goes with my favorite 20 releases of 2017. Your tastes are not mine, you will disagree, but maybe there is something here that you might not have discovered, something of beauty that might bring you joy. At one point I thought this might be a thin year; when I got down to making the list I realized there was no filler at the bottom. Exact placement is fuzzy – there are lots of apples and oranges being compared here. Feel free to move any of these up or down a few places in your head.</p>
<p><a href="https://12kmusic.bandcamp.com/album/somi"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5412" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/top-20-of-2017-david-smith/Somi-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="200" srcset="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/top-20-of-2017-david-smith/Somi-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/top-20-of-2017-david-smith/Somi-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/top-20-of-2017-david-smith/Somi.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" /></a><strong>#1. Taylor Deupree – Somi</strong></p>
<p>Deupree’s <em>Faint</em> from a few years ago is still one of my regular listens and pleasures, and I wonder with hindsight if I should have placed it at number one that year. He gave me another chance with the magnificent, meditative <em>Somi</em>. Loops of single notes from acoustic instruments played at varying intervals are layered and treated to create a fascinating slow dance of beauty and rest. And the deluxe edition packaging was as gorgeous as the music. (<a href="https://12kmusic.bandcamp.com/album/somi">Listen</a>)</p>

<p><strong>#2. Daniel Herskedal – The Roc</strong></p>
<p>Norwegian tubaist Herskedal’s new album adds an Arabic influence to his tuba-based jazz-folk explorations. The result is a unique, at times magical set of tunes high in atmosphere and richly colored. Several parts of this album stayed in my head all year. (<a href="https://danielherskedal.bandcamp.com/album/the-roc">Listen</a>)</p>

<p><strong>#3. Pausal – Avifaunal</strong></p>
<p>Pausal’s warm and finely textured drones have been growing on me the last few years. This year’s release took things up a notch, with a sweeping grandeur and narrative flow that make each minute count. An album to get lost in. (<a href="https://dronarivm.bandcamp.com/album/avifaunal">Listen</a>)</p>

<p><a href="http://anzicstore.com/album/happy-song"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5417" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/top-20-of-2017-david-smith/Anat-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a></p>
<p><strong>#4. Anat Cohen Tentet – Happy Song</strong></p>
<p>The title and bright yellow cover are apt. New York-based Israeli clarinetist Cohen and her ensemble deliver a vibrantly grooving set of jazz romps that shift in character as the album progresses while maintaining an infectious sense of joy. (<a href="http://anzicstore.com/album/happy-song">Listen</a>)</p>

<p><strong>#5. Tinariwen – Elwan</strong></p>
<p>The Saharan blues return with the latest from the great Tuareg band, and it’s one of their finest. The sinuous, swaying rhythms undergird starkly poetic laments at the loss of social and environmental fabric.

<p><strong>#6. Seldom Sene Recorder Consort – Goldberg Variations</strong></p>
<p>As the title gives away, this is the Goldberg Variations played on recorders by a Dutch recorder consort. In addition to the virtuoso playing, the different sonorities of the wind instruments made the Goldbergs sparkle for me in a gentle and delightful new way. (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJQAgA44gCM">Listen</a>) (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdpwCWBuXpI">Listen</a>)</p>

<p><strong>#7. Otto A. Totland – The Lost</strong></p>
<p>Very similar in spirit to its predecessor, <em>Pinô</em>, this second album of piano solos again showcases Norwegian pianist Otto Totland’s ability to conjure a gentle, plaintive warmth through small melodies and soft sounds. (<a href="https://ottoatotland.bandcamp.com/">Listen</a>)</p>

<p><strong>#8. Chihei Hatakeyama &amp; Federico Durand – Sora</strong></p>
<p>Combining Hatakeyama’s characteristic gossamer tonal washes and Durand’s delightfully pattering small sounds is a recipe for enormous prettiness, and that is just what we get on this deeply calming album. (<a href="https://chiheihatakeyama.bandcamp.com/album/sora">Listen</a>)</p>

<p><strong>#9. The Green Kingdom – The North Wind and the Sun</strong></p>
<p>The Green Kingdom has issued a long series of recordings offering an attractive world of delicate small sounds and textures. This release feels like something fresh as it bursts forth into uplifting melody thanks to the foregrounded guitar work. (<a href="https://thegreenkingdom.bandcamp.com/album/the-north-wind-and-the-sun">Listen/Watch</a>)</p>

<p><strong>#10. Emile Parisien, Vincent Peirani, Andreas Schaerer &amp; Michael Wollny – Out of Land</strong></p>
<p>An unusual but top-notch European jazz combo consisting of sax, accordion, piano, and vocalizations/beatboxing. The live recordings prickle with energy and abound in creativity, making for an exciting listen. (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAKio4qfeqM">Watch</a>)</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://homeassemblymusic.bandcamp.com/album/weve-all-been-swimming"><img class="alignleft wp-image-5421 size-thumbnail" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/top-20-of-2017-david-smith/Fieldhead-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/top-20-of-2017-david-smith/Fieldhead-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/top-20-of-2017-david-smith/Fieldhead-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/top-20-of-2017-david-smith/Fieldhead-768x768.jpg 768w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/top-20-of-2017-david-smith/Fieldhead-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/top-20-of-2017-david-smith/Fieldhead.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a></strong></p>
<p><strong>#11. Fieldhead – We’ve All Been Swimming</strong></p>
<p>Fieldhead’s latest is by far my favorite by the artist so far. It plays with odd rhythmic combinations, layering looping synth melodies over divergent rhythms. The result is a kind of mellow fascination, and great fun. (<a href="https://homeassemblymusic.bandcamp.com/album/weve-all-been-swimming">Listen</a>)</p>

<p><strong>#12. Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark – The Punishment of Luxury</strong></p>
<p>Not much pop makes my lists, but I loved OMD as a teen, and this new release sounds as if it could have been the immediate follow up to 1983’s <em>Dazzle Ships</em>. It nails what made their original Kraftwerk-with-soul sound special, and that made me grin. (<a href="https://officialomd.bandcamp.com/releases">Listen</a>)</p>

<p><strong>#13. Rudresh Mahanthappa/Indo-Pak Coalition – Agrima </strong></p>

<p><strong>#14. Helge Lien Trio – Guzuguzu</strong></p>
<p>With track titles drawn from Japanese onomatopoeia, Helge Lien’s latest piano trio album is made up of moody evocations of atmosphere and movement, often skirting around song structures.

<p><strong>#15. Porya Hatami – Monads</strong></p>
<p>When I posted my review of this to Facebook none of my friends hit “like,” and it is admittedly a pretty abstract set of experiments with sound rather than a collection of tunes. But they are fascinating experiments, glimpses into the push-and-pull of forces that make the world a place with sound.

<p><strong>#16. Yazz Ahmed – La Saboteuse</strong></p>
<p>Ahmed is a British-Bahraini trumpeter who here successfully melds Arabic motifs, electronic treatments, and jazz trumpet in a set of beguiling tunes. (<a href="https://yazzahmed.bandcamp.com/album/la-saboteuse-2">Listen</a>)</p>

<p><strong>#17. Alea Saxophone Quartet – Arvo Pärt: Anima</strong></p>
<p>If the idea of Pärt played on saxophones conjures up a mental collision of ethereal voices and ill-chosen skronking, think again. The pure tones and harmonies of the sax quartet evocatively capture the spirit of Pärt’s austere choral pieces.

<p><strong>#18. Taylor Deupree &amp; Marcus Fischer – Lowlands</strong></p>
<p>Building on previous outings as a duo, Deupree and Fischer again show a mastery of the microscopic world of small resonances, adding another delightful release to their growing oeuvre. (<a href="https://12kmusic.bandcamp.com/album/lowlands">Listen</a>)</p>

<p><strong>#19. Brot &amp; Sterne – Tales of Herbst</strong></p>
<p>This was not quite like anything else I listened to, which is perhaps not surprising in the case of a hurdy-gurdy/hang drum/trumpet jazz trio.

<p><strong>#20. Billow Observatory – II: Plains/Patterns </strong></p>
<p>More active than their debut release, this collection of ambient pieces pulses and shimmers airily. Enjoyable throughout. (<a href="https://billowobservatory.bandcamp.com/album/ii-plains-patterns">Listen</a>)</p>

<p><strong>The next 10&#8230;</strong></p>
<p>And here are ten more that I had a really hard time cutting to get the list down to 20. Some of these jumped in and out of my list several times, and might have made it if I had finalized the list tomorrow. Alphabetically:</p>
<p>Wil Bolton – Night Paths (Ambient)</p>
<p>Bruce Cockburn – Bone on Bone (Folk)</p>
<p>Marcus Fischer – Loss (Ambient)</p>
<p>From the Mouth of the Sun – Hymn Binding (Modern Classical)</p>
<p>Ian Hawgood &amp; Wil Bolton – Transparencies (Ambient)</p>
<p>Hudson – Hudson (Jazz)</p>
<p>Rafael Anton Irisarri – The Shameless Years (Ambient)</p>
<p>Benedikt Jahnel Trio – The Invariant (Piano jazz)</p>
<p>Darren McClure – Nature Mirror (Ambient)</p>
<p>Phronesis, Julian Argüelles, &amp; Frankfurt Radio Big Band – The Behemoth (Jazz)</p>
<p>As ever, if any of the artists happen by, thank you for another year of inspiring music.</p>

<p>This recent release floats up out of a yawning gap, so let&#8217;s back up the story a little for anyone who lost the thread. 1 Mile North’s first album, <a href="https://wortcunner.bandcamp.com/album/glass-wars"><em>Glass Wars</em></a>, was a collection of pretty guitar cogitations a little reminiscent in places of some of the quieter moments on <em>How Strange Innocence</em>, the first album by Explosions in the Sky from a year earlier. At the time it was one of quite a few of its kind floating around at the gently lyrical end of the post-rock spectrum. It was the second album, <a href="https://wortcunner.bandcamp.com/album/minor-shadows"><em>Minor Shadows</em></a>, released two years later in 2003, that made me sit up and take notice. While somewhat similar in feel to its predecessor, it achieved an increased tautness and sense of purpose and space, moving deftly from sparse beauty to wistful, melancholy drift to occasional pockets of darkness. It did not sound quite like any of its rivals, and it remains one of my most-returned-to albums from the post-rock binge that filled a chunk of my hard drive around that time. It’s a lonely, fragile, contemplative work, and the haunting opener “In 1983 he loved to fly” is to my ear perhaps its finest moment.</p>
<p><span id="more-5390"></span></p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5j1bp5ebFXE" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Apart from a split release a year later, that, was it. Thirteen years is a long time between album releases. It’s a testimony to the impression that <em>Minor Shadow</em>s made on me that I was still keeping an eye out every now and then to see if anything else might emerge. Late in 2016, a new album finally appeared, titled <em><a href="https://wortcunner.bandcamp.com/album/awakened-by-decay">Awakened by Decay</a> </em>and available on vinyl and digitally<em>.</em> This was interesting news, and I approached it with high hopes.</p>
<p>First impression: the minor shadows have become pools of darkness. The cover art is darker. The title leaves me wondering whether it alludes to fading musical notes or to awareness of the approaching end of life. The track titles circle around dark expanses, separations, absences. And yes, the music too is darker in hue, though without letting go of an underlying warmth carried by the silkily melodic phrases. It feels dark but not too bleak, like dark chocolate. The sense of profound patience and taut restraint is still there, there is still the atmospheric, almost hypnotic meditation on a few select notes. Yet where the earlier material often sounds to me like the attenuated air of wild open spaces, the new album, while firmly in the vein of the earlier material, feels more claustrophobic. The drones that accompany the plaintive guitar meditations are a touch heavier and more insistent, creating a tense undercurrent that tugs at the fragments of melody from beneath.</p>
<p>A comparison that comes to mind is late-period Labradford (that’s a huge compliment, by the way). The palette is sparse: a plangent guitar mutters phrases to itself, drones fill the air around it with a brooding mist, occasional languid percussion and piano add mesmerizing forward motion, a couple of snatches of spoken text drift by. The tracks are held together not so much by melody or dramatic arc as by the sheer tautness of the atmosphere in which they lazily swim. At some points I wonder if this is not so much music characterized by moodiness as moodiness distilled into aural form. It is music that asks a fair bit of the listener, calling for a contemplative patience, a willingness to languish in the slowly unfurling sounds, absorbed in the slowly swaying motion of the journey rather than expecting to be dazzled by any sudden landmarks along the way. A key test for this kind of thing is whether it can maintain the tension, avoid breaking the spell. It does not quite manage that equally strongly across the whole album to my ear—I have my favorite tracks—but there is a remarkable consistency of tone, with enough variety to hold my attention and nudge me onward. You won’t be humming it any time afterwards, but you might just get drawn into its rich, thick textures and meditative lyricism, and if you do, you’ll be glad you went along for the ride. Here&#8217;s hoping it&#8217;s not 13 years until the next installment.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As I prepared <a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//2016/12/top-20-of-2016-david-smith/">this year&#8217;s top 20 list</a>, I discovered that several of my favorite releases this year were not full albums, but brief EPs. Including them in the top 20 albums list felt a bit like trying to compare novels and short stories, so I decided to list them separately. These were my top 5 favorite EPs of 2016:</p>

A wonderful surprise at the end of the year: three Pjusk collaborations. Loscil, Porya Hatami, and SHAO add their musical perspectives, and the distinctive sound of Pjusk remains present in each track. Brilliant stuff.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Fifteen minutes of warm, spacious, crackly, resonant, luxuriant sound. My favorite of Wil Bolton&#8217;s several releases this year. Check out his <a href="https://wilbolton.bandcamp.com/album/maemi"><em>Maemi</em></a> EP and the full-length <em><a href="https://wilbolton.bandcamp.com/album/february-dawn">February Dawn</a> </em>as well.</p>

My list had its share of gentleness this year, but for moments when something more hard-edged fit the bill, this short collection of rumbling minimalist techno in the classic raster-noton vein was an excellent stand-by.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><br />
<img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5363" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/top-20-of-2016-david-smith/Murcof-EP01-150x150.jpg" alt="murcof-ep01" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/top-20-of-2016-david-smith/Murcof-EP01-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/top-20-of-2016-david-smith/Murcof-EP01-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/top-20-of-2016-david-smith/Murcof-EP01.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" />#4. <a href="https://infine-rec.bandcamp.com/album/ep01">Murcof and Vanessa Wagner &#8211; EP01</a></strong><br />
By turns darkly brooding and gently melancholy, this turbulent-electronics-meets-Satie release stuck with me even after the full-length album that followed it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5364" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/top-20-of-2016-david-smith/Jazzdefector-150x150.jpg" alt="jazzdefector" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/top-20-of-2016-david-smith/Jazzdefector-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/top-20-of-2016-david-smith/Jazzdefector-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/top-20-of-2016-david-smith/Jazzdefector.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /><strong>#5. <a href="https://audiogourmet.bandcamp.com/album/miniatures">Jazzdefector &#8211; Miniatures</a></strong></p>
<p>Finally, something more relaxing. A series of very short pieces of effects-laden guitar offer a summery interlude, warm and pretty.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s been a quiet 2016 at <em>Metelaifne Music</em>. Professional commitments have left some regulars with less time for blogging. But we&#8217;re still listening. Here are my top 20 albums for 2016. I excluded compilations (though <a href="http://shop.serein.co.uk/album/orbital-planes-passenger-trains-vol-1"><em>Orbital Planes &amp; Passenger Trains, Vol. 1</em></a> from Serein, <a href="https://dronarivm.bandcamp.com/album/into-the-white-new-years-2016-free-compilation"><em>Into the White</em></a> from Dronarivm, and <a href="https://www.fat-cat.co.uk/release/eleven-into-fifteen-a-130701-compilation"><em>Eleven into Fifteen</em></a> from 130701 all delighted me). As ever, this is the best in my subjective judgment of what I heard and liked, no more, and the numbering is less important than the chance of helping someone find something good that they missed. This year I am treating EPs separately, <a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//?p=5331&#038;preview=true">in a second post</a>.<span id="more-5329"></span></p>

<p><strong>#1.</strong> <a href="https://federicodurand.bandcamp.com/album/a-trav-s-del-espejo"><strong>Federico Durand – A Través Del Espejo</strong></a><br />
This delightful album was released on 12k early in the year, and I kept listening to it all year. (My wife liked it too, which is far from guaranteed with the more experimental fringes of my listening.) A childlike celebration of tiny, fragile sounds, and a reminder of what can be destroyed by noise and bombast, this album offers a series of delicate meditations on the vulnerable beauty of sound. Durand&#8217;s <a href="https://federicodurand.bandcamp.com/"><em>Jardín de invierno</em></a> (on Spekk) deserves honorable mention in the same vein, but it was this earlier release that captivated my ears the most this year.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>#2. <a href="https://play.spotify.com/album/2EvZiOMBlC9b5hbjbZCjZv?play=true&#038;utm_source=open.spotify.com&#038;utm_medium=open">Nicolas Jaar &#8211; Sirens</a></strong><br />
The haunting first track displays magnificently Jaar&#8217;s precise mastery of his palette of sounds. The album continues with a compelling sideways take on a variety of song forms, with the thematic focus on a culture of political violence providing a dark textual undercurrent. A remarkable piece of work, whether one focuses on the catchy songs, on the textual warnings, or on the meticulously shaped sonic shifts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>#<strong>3. <a href="https://kaitlynaureliasmith.bandcamp.com/album/frkwys-vol-13-sunergy">Kaitlyn Aurelia Smith &amp; Suzanne Ciani &#8211; Sunergy</a></strong><br />
An inspired set of Buchla synthesizer improvisations from a senior master of the art and a new rising star (Smith&#8217;s solo album <a href="https://kaitlynaureliasmith.bandcamp.com/album/ears"><em>Ears</em></a> this year was also excellent). Sequences burble and sparkle over shifting hums and currents, providing a compelling update to the long-form analog synthesizer genre.</p>

What if Brian Eno&#8217;s classic ambient work, <em>Music for Airports,</em> were recorded as a jazz album? Chris Schlarb showed us this year that the results could be very enjoyable indeed. We also get a new, complementary piece, the &#8220;working man&#8217;s counterpart&#8221; to music for airports titled &#8220;Music for Bus Stops.&#8221; Both pieces charmed me.</p>

An acoustic guitar meanders gently and peacefully as an unsettled bed of chirping, buzzing, warbling, squeaking electronics chatters tensely alongside, setting up a fascinating conversation that sometimes produces tension, sometimes converges.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Ostermeier &#8211; Tiny Birds</a></strong><br />
Building on last year&#8217;s <em>Still</em>, M. Ostermeier returned with an aptly titled collection of short, plaintive piano pieces. Accompanied by background rustles and rattles, the tracks are sparse, stark, melancholy, almost hesitant in their deliberation. The sound is intimate, inviting us to slow down and attend rather than carrying us along.</p>

David Newman&#8217;s recent releases have struck an absorbing balance between experimental exploration of the properties of sound and a melodic presence, and this collaboration with Justin Varis continues in the same rich vein. Remixes by various luminaries of the genre add a further dimension to this charming collection of off-kilter pieces.</p>

Korwar takes field recordings of folk music from Indian villages and marries them with jazz and electronics so skilfully that it is hard to see the joins. Raw recordings of chant and percussion from India provide the substrate that morphs into engaging jazz sequences that extend the sources without leaving them behind. A striking, unusual release.</p>

<p><strong><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5341" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/top-20-of-2016-david-smith/loscil-monument-150x150.jpg" alt="loscil-monument" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/top-20-of-2016-david-smith/loscil-monument-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/top-20-of-2016-david-smith/loscil-monument-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/top-20-of-2016-david-smith/loscil-monument.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" />#9. <a href="https://loscil.bandcamp.com/album/monument-builders">Loscil &#8211; Monument Builders</a></strong><br />
Loscil continues to find new angles on his distinctive sound, and his latest contains some of his most aggressive rhythms to date. It also serves up a fresh helping of his signature hypnotically shimmering pulses. I have never met a Loscil album I didn&#8217;t like, and this latest release more than kept the streak going.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><br />
<img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5350" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/top-20-of-2016-david-smith/Soderstrom-Om-Solen-150x150.jpeg" alt="soderstrom-om-solen" width="150" height="150" />#10. <a href="http://floraochfauna.tictail.com/product/andreas-soderstrom-om-solen-val-gar-upp-lp">Andreas Söderström – Om Solen Väl Går Upp</a></strong><br />
Resonant guitar notes follow one another at a gentle, leisurely pace. An ethereal atmosphere builds amid their resonance. Chiming rhythms eventually arrive, but only accentuate the calm. The album drifts by lazily, a slow caress.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

An evocative follow-up to Tiento de las Nieves, Tiento de la Luz offers a glacially paced interaction of piano, viola da gamba, and electronics. As usual with Köner, deep frequencies and extended textures play an important role, with the decay of each note held before us for contemplation. Mesmerizing listening.</p>

<p><strong>#12. <a href="https://slaapwel.bandcamp.com/album/filament">Gareth Davis &#8211; Filament</a></strong><br />
A rich, undulating, 35-minute drone, embedded in field recordings of the ocean, gains texture from the use of bass and contrabass clarinet along with electronics. Deep rumbles and whale-song-like squeaks ebb, and flow, and sway to deeply atmospheric effect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>#13 <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sky-Dancers-Henri-Texier/dp/B01BESIPD0/ref=tmm_msc_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&#038;qid=&#038;sr=">Henri Texier &#8211; Sky Dancers</a></strong></p>
<p>The Native American sonic references may be a little hokey here and there, but the more I listened to this release from French jazz bass veteran Henri Texier the more the tunes sank their hooks into me. The live reprise released later in the year, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dakota-Mab-Live-Theater-G-tersloh/dp/B01CORX2WE/ref=tmm_msc_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&#038;qid=&#038;sr=" class="broken_link"><em>Dakota Mab</em></a>, is worth a listen too.</p>

<p><strong>#14 <a href="https://timereleasedsound.bandcamp.com/album/kaziwa">Porya Hatami and Arovane &#8211; Kaziwa</a></strong></p>
<p>Piano again, now heard through a rich haze of sonic manipulation, tinkling amid a crackle and rush of air, emerging from a busy hum, chiming like bells, meandering sadly, punctuating an ominous buzz. Porya Hatami and Uwe Zahn keep shifting the sonic palette a little, crowding the electronic atmosphere with portent as the piano soldiers bravely on.</p>

#15. <a href="https://machinefabriek.bandcamp.com/album/crumble">Machinefabriek &#8211; Crumble</a></strong><br />
This is not background music. It seems at any given moment as if little is happening, yet the whole unfolds in a way that feels tautly dramatic, like a small movie made of slight violin scrapes, hisses, metallic reverberations, wordless vocalizations, the sounds of something important happening, just over the horizon and almost out of earshot.</p>

Nils Frahm got together with some childhood friends to revisit and remix some tapes they had made decades ago. The result is a collection of atmospheric lo-fi instrumentals that somehow manage to sound reminiscent of Frahm&#8217;s solo work while being little like his previous material in form.</p>

McClure trades more in precise measures of sound than in tunes. Each track on this immersive, painstakingly crafted album invites the listener to meditate on a specific quality of carefully constructed sound, ranging from the nature-tinged water-and-hum of the opening track to almost-not-there gossamer drones and unexpected pulses.</p>

There are stretches in which this album sounds like a gaggle of synthesizers improvising by themselves, without human intervention. Bright, chiming sounds ripple and cascade merrily. Stick around, though, and the two long pieces begin to develop and morph, building into rich swathes of sound.</p>

Drone and noise, crackle and hum, chaotic dissolution of sound and a massive sense of grandeur &#8211; these are the basic building blocks of <em>Continuum</em>. Jebanasam sets out to capture &#8220;the spectrum of life, power and energy present in the universe&#8221; and emerges with a dramatic set of drone compositions.</p>

The practically ungooglable title gave me some trouble tracking down this unusual release. It began from recordings of the sounds of bees in their hives and built instrumental compositions around the bee drones and buzzes. The music is pastoral, and the interweaving of natural and instrumental sounds is quite sensitively done.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here is my top 20 music releases for 2015, with no claim that they are somehow objectively the best or that I listened to everything anyone else did. I have found things that delighted me on other people’s lists, and the point of the exercise is not to replicate or compete with those lists but to highlight some things you may not have found, things that might delight you. The sequence changed every time I made a shortlist, so take the numbers with a pinch of salt – all of them could be at least plus or minus 5 on a given day.<span id="more-5218"></span></p>
<p><img class="alignleft wp-image-5195" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/review-inscriptions-by-wil-bolton/Inscriptions-150x150.jpg" alt="Inscriptions" width="200" height="200" srcset="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/review-inscriptions-by-wil-bolton/Inscriptions-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/review-inscriptions-by-wil-bolton/Inscriptions.jpg 280w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>#1.</strong> <strong>Wil Bolton – Inscriptions</strong><br />
I have loved many of Wil Bolton’s releases, and this one was especially captivating, a cohesive suite of carefully textured ambient soundscapes of great warmth and delicacy. A delight for the ears from start to finish. Full review <a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//2015/12/review-inscriptions-by-wil-bolton/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>#2. Nils Frahm – Solo</strong><br />
Nils Frahm has had a prolific year, including a film score and electronic duets with Ólafur Arnalds, but where he remains unrivaled is as a painter of fragile intimacy on the piano. This collection of solo piano pieces did not disappoint, offering both slow affection and rhythmic drive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5233" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Kari-Ikonen-150x150.jpg" alt="Kari Ikonen" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Kari-Ikonen-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Kari-Ikonen.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>#<strong>3. Kari Ikonen Trio &#8211; Beauteous Tales and Offbeat Stories</strong><br />
From scampering piano romps to meditative arco bass passages, from stately melodies to discordant experimental interludes, this album charms with its variety and adds another thread to my fondness for Scandinavian piano jazz.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5229" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Hatami-mcclure-150x150.jpg" alt="Hatami mcclure" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Hatami-mcclure-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Hatami-mcclure.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" />#4. Porya Hatami and Darren Mcclure – In-Between Spaces</strong><br />
A delicious marriage of McClure’s abstract tones and Hatami’s gently burbling textures, this joint essay in textured ambiance is gently reflective in mood, a continual, fragile, questing movement within a basic rest. Another excellent release for Hatami, and a fine companion to McClure’s excellent Primary Locations from earlier in the year.</p>

Den Sorte Skole – Indians and Cowboys</strong><br />
Den Sorte Skole take thousands of small samples from old vinyl records and weave them into eclectic tapestries in which they become a cohesive, dappled, new whole. An unerring sense of groove is married to sounds and voices from the past and around the world. Get it for free at the artists’ site <a href="http://densorteskole.net/">here</a>.</p>

Esmerine &#8211; Lost Voices</strong><br />
Marimba, percussion and strings are the backbone of Esmerine’s moody miniatures. The music sometimes shares the ponderous majesty of related bands godspeed you! black emperor and Thee Silver Mt. Zion, but its idiom is more acoustic, rooted in marimba, strings and drums. Lost Voices builds gentle rhythms, passages of lyrical beauty, and outbreaks of restrained melodic intensity into a wistful and dramatic whole, arguably their best yet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Emily Hall – Folie à Deux</strong><br />
Ostensibly an opera about shared delusion and receiving cosmic messages from an electricity pylon, this charming release sounds more like ambient than opera. Pure, melodic voices meditate dreamily on madness and our relationship to each other and the world that speaks through our electric technologies to the accompaniment of electronic textures, creating a mesmerizing and delightful sound.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5232" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Kangding-Ray-150x150.jpeg" alt="Kangding Ray" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Kangding-Ray-150x150.jpeg 150w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Kangding-Ray-300x300.jpeg 300w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Kangding-Ray.jpeg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" />#8. Kangding Ray – Cory Arcane</strong><br />
I expected this year’s blockbuster from the raster-noton label to be Alva Noto’s Xerrox 3 (which I liked, but am still growing to love), but in the short term at least was more impacted by Kangding Ray’s uneasily skittering techno. Intricate rhythms shift and collide, accompanied by a narrative about the decay of consumerist technological society yet carrying a visceral appeal as pure sound.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5222" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Autistici-150x150.jpg" alt="Autistici" width="150" height="150" />#9. Autistici – Temporal Enhancement</strong><br />
Abstract in concept (an exploration of our perception of sound in its relation to time) and in execution (a focus on sounds themselves and their tensions with one another), this album nevertheless also manages to cohere as a compelling and finely wrought listening experience. The second entry on this list from the Dronarivm label, which had a fine year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5224" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Dag-Rosenqvist-150x150.jpg" alt="Dag Rosenqvist" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Dag-Rosenqvist-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Dag-Rosenqvist-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Dag-Rosenqvist-768x768.jpg 768w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Dag-Rosenqvist-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Dag-Rosenqvist.jpg 1181w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" />#10. Dag Rosenqvist – The Forest Diaries</strong><br />
Rosenqvist had a busy year, but charmed me most with this disarmingly simple set of piano/organ meditations that combine stillness with an undercurrent of dissonance. Notes are allowed to linger and decay, giving time to absorb and reflect. Music for a thoughtful evening.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5241" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Deupree-150x150.jpg" alt="Deupree" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Deupree-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Deupree-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Deupree.jpg 590w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" />#11. Taylor Deupree and Marcus Fischer – Twine</strong><br />
Another serving of the distinctive kind of microscopic beauty that Deupree’s 12k label has been honing for many years now. Gently hissing tape loops undulate their way softly through time, sparsely dusted with gentle chimes and wobbles, seeping softly into the future.</p>

<p><strong>#12. En – City of Brides</strong><br />
En’s follow up to the excellent Already Gone uses their distinctive palette to good effect. Passages of calmly undulating drones sit in tension with densely layered flurries of sound that reach for a cascading majesty, all heard through a dreamy, blurring filter. A distinctive world to get lost in. Full review<a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//2015/12/review-city-of-brides-by-en/"> here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>#13 Seckou Keita &#8211; 22 Strings</strong></p>
<p>This album offers elegant, and life-affirming instrumentals by a master kora-player from Senegal, a few of them accompanied by gentle vocals. African and Western sensibilities interweave in the compositions, and the sound is delicate and warmly inviting.</p>

<p><strong>#14 Goldmund &#8211; Sometimes</strong></p>
<p>Another entry in the atmospheric piano miniatures genre, this deeply melodic and contemplative album combines the gentle piano gestures with light electronic washes to create a beautiful sonic landscape that invites introspection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5235" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Port-st-willow-150x150.jpg" alt="Port st willow" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Port-st-willow-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Port-st-willow-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Port-st-willow.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" />#15. Port St. Willow – Syncope</strong><br />
The instrumentation here is sparse and restrained, the falsetto vocal plaintive. Patient percussion, punctuating flutters of guitar and electronics, and the undulating melodies create an atmosphere that reminds me of late-period, post-pop Talk Talk.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Ian William Craig – Cradle for the Wanting</strong><br />
Ian William Craig has spent several albums doggedly refining an unusual recipe – ambient compositions based on varying kinds of manipulation of his trained tenor voice. Cradle for the Wanting is perhaps the purest installment yet, the haunting, wordless vocals dancing with their own sonic decay.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5223" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Chris-Bissonnette-150x150.jpg" alt="Chris Bissonnette" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Chris-Bissonnette-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Chris-Bissonnette-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Chris-Bissonnette.jpg 745w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" />#17. Christopher Bissonnette &#8211; Pitch, Paper &amp; Foil</strong><br />
Very much in continuity with last year’s Essays in Idleness, this album continues Bissonnette’s move away from his earlier ambient palette and into his engagement with quavering synth soliloquies. I am left feeling as if it is less a matter of playing music on the synth and more of coaxing the synth into speech, drawing forth a fragile voice from it that sings in its own expressive tongue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5231" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Irisarri-150x150.jpg" alt="Irisarri" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Irisarri-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Irisarri.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" />#18. Rafael Anton Irisarri &#8211; A Fragile Geography</strong><br />
Irisarri’s work is consistently worth listening to, and here as always he achieves a depth of texture and grandness of gesture that lend tremendous weight and presence to his dronescapes. Another important release to add to his growing oeuvre.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Alva Noto &#8211; Xerrox Vol 3</strong><br />
Xerrox Vol 2 is an album that I admire greatly, and there was a 6-year wait for its successor; I think my ears were therefore too primed for something similar. Xerrox 3 is more sparse and subdued and yet also more overtly emotive. Like all of Carsten Nicolai’s work it exudes precision and care. I suspect it will continue to grow on me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Fabio Biondi &#8211; Vivaldi: I concerti dell&#8217;addio</strong><br />
I ended up listening to a lot of Vivaldi this year after learning that his music didn’t have to be played like the Vivaldi I grew up hearing. Fabio Biondi’s versions of Vivaldi are always vibrant, and this new collection has rich texture and the accustomed verve.</p>

<p>En&#8217;s last album, <em>Already Gone</em>, (<a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//2012/04/review-already-gone-by-en/" target="_blank">review here</a>) was notable both for its distinctive palette of sounds and for its cohesion. It offered a succession of tracks of increasing length, culminating and resolving in a 20-minute meditation on <em>Elysium</em>, the mythical Greek isle of the blessed. <a href="http://studentsofdecay.com/post/132222852294/en-city-of-brides" target="_blank"><em>City of Brides</em> </a>(the title of the new double LP and of its closing track &#8211; another eschatological tinge, I wonder?) is less linear. Indeed it thrives on a restless exploration of shifting and contrasting sounds, skipping from noise to clarity, from stasis to rippling motion, from soft to abrasive as we wander from moment to moment and from track to track. And yet there remains a sense of deep unity, as if the various tracks are somehow probing the same question, prodding at the same possibility.<span id="more-5200"></span></p>
<p>The opener, <em>Blades</em>, greets us with a melodic buzz of distorted, metallic tones that gyrate their way into an encroaching bed of noise until they end up circling in a sludgy loop. It seems a rather abrasive beginning, especially to ears that remember <em>Elysium</em>, but somehow makes sense as we hit the sudden contrast with its successor. The abrupt clarity of the resounding clusters of plucked koto notes that begin <em>Dead Ringer</em> is a startling shift, yet those notes too begin to buzz with a growing halo of distortion, until the clear opening notes finally reassert themselves. Listening to this track after <em>Blades</em> is a little like reading a novel in which the scene suddenly shifts to a new location which turns out to be part of the same story. Then <em>Blonde is Back</em> takes us down another path, plunging us into a warmly drifting wash of sound punctuated by subtle bass thrums, dreamy and soft &#8211; and yet embedded in a continuing abrasive buzz that retains a thread of continuity with the preceding tracks. As the buzz recedes, the whole slowly submerges in a gauzy sea of synthetic whispers. We have been led through three contrasting sound worlds, three sonic rooms, apparently held together by the halo of noise through which they emerge.</p>
<p>The same sense of contrast and continuity plays throughout the album. The wittily titled <em>Awkward Paws</em> offers pattering drops of sound echoing in a gentle haze, before a flock of strings flurries past like a sudden patter of rain, leaving behind a clean, peaceful drone, clearly evoking motifs from <em>Already Gone</em>. Just as we ease into rest, a scratchy, percussive abrasion interrupts the reverie and jolts us into the wonderful <em>Mendocino Nature Rave</em>. The earthy creaking anchors a more spacey realm of quavering, whooshing, synthetic sounds. The swoops and oscillations gather in increasing density, creating a deliciously rich, twittering crescendo that marries depth and majesty with eddying motion before fading into a spray of echoing pulses. This pair of tracks highlights a recurring duality in En’s music, which offers contrasting paths to bliss: a restful calm evoked by warmly and sedately swaying tones, or an accumulation of so many simultaneously scurrying, circling flurries of sound that a kind of deep grandeur emerges, like all the creatures of the world glimpsed at once in motion. (<em>Secret Samba</em> offers another very effective instance of this latter effect.)</p>
<p>Two of the tracks form a dyad. <em>Songs for Diminished Lovemaking Part 1</em> initially calms the proceedings with a steady, soft drone before bright sweeps of reedy sound rise from it and swirl restlessly, questing upward over a slight, gentle rhythm until the track quietly draws to a close. A few tracks later, <em>Part 2</em> opens morosely with a subdued hum, deep gurgles, and a forlorn scrape of strings straining to attain forward motion. The effort is repeated with gradually increasing force and breadth of sound until a grander resonance is attained, like an orchestra tuning while trying to rise from a bubbling swamp. Further adding to the loose sense of architecture, the scratchy rhythms, bubbling synthetic sounds, and gritty crackles of album closer <em>City of Brides</em> create a blend of melody and noise that recalls the opening track.</p>
<p>En&#8217;s music is not about well-defined shapes and clear edges. Patterns overlap, swirl in moiré motion, and dissolve, warm drones wobble and sway at a languid distance, and clear, sharp notes emerge only as fleeting moments of orientation. Pervading both <em>Already Gone</em> and <em>City of Brides</em> is a nostalgic evocation of a blurry transcendence, a gesture toward a world of fluttering beauty and healing calm heard through the mist of dreams, through the indistinct sway of a warm ocean, or through a grainy filter of imperfection. En&#8217;s music evokes without clearly naming, painting in sound a world not quite graspable but beautiful nonetheless. It leaves a lasting impression and amply rewards repeated listening.

<p>I didn&#8217;t plan to write a review tonight. But the CD was playing and it caught me up and carried me away and I had to write&#8230;</p>
<p>Wil Bolton&#8217;s music is part of the texture of my world. I always enjoy his releases to one degree or another, but a handful of them have risen from &#8220;this is nice&#8221; to &#8220;this is one of my favorite things&#8221;. The expressive chimes of <a href="https://wilbolton.bandcamp.com/album/time-lapse" target="_blank"><em>Time Lapse</em></a> and <a href="https://wilbolton.bandcamp.com/album/chimes-for-a-wall-drawing" target="_blank"><em>Chimes for a Wall Drawing</em></a> call forth wonder and remain in my listening rotation years after their release.<span id="more-5185"></span> <a href="https://soundcloud.com/distant-noise-records/wil-tarl-angel-in-the-house" target="_blank">Angel in the House</a>, by Wil &amp; Tarl, is a marvelous drone piece. The last several releases I have enjoyed, but they did not quite creep up onto my inner list of most-favored recordings. And then <a href="https://wilbolton.bandcamp.com/album/inscriptions" target="_blank">Inscriptions</a> came along on Moscow&#8217;s consistently excellent <a href="https://dronarivm.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank">Dronarivm</a> label and charmed me completely.</p>
<p>At the outset, little, softly darting sounds and questing essays on guitar strings draw us into a lush bed of sound, a title track astir with possibility, caressing the air with a gentle, exploratory touch. A deep, rich drone forms an enveloping bed and the guitar notes, rather than playing over or in front of it, seem increasingly to emerge from it and sigh back into its velvety texture. A tight flurry of pulses recurs from time to time, restating an inchoate question. We could rest here for a long time, quite still and in perpetual motion. <em>Hedera</em>, track 2, is for me perhaps the high point of a consistently strong album. A warm droning loop sways sedately, its constant round-and-round-and-up-and-down motion as mesmerizing and soothing as the gentle sway of a kelp forest in a tropical sea. The guitar meditates in a loose, questing pattern as bird cries and small, darting buzzes weave intricately around the sounds. The overall effect is detailed and fascinating, and as warm and wallowing as a fresh-run bath on a winter evening. That the track sways on for some time without departing from its message is part of its success; I never want it to end.</p>
<p>End it does, but <em>Seed</em> picks up right where it left off. It modulates the tone a little, adds some human sounds of children playing and some creaks and crackles, offers a slightly more purposeful guitar pattern, and sways ever onward. As I listen I am again impressed with how complex the mood is. This music is warm and comforting. It is melancholy and wistful. It is gently affirming of world and life. It is nostalgic and thoughtful. It is questioning and pensive. It is often all of these things at the same time, a restful restlessness that allows the listener to ease back and relax in the swell or become fully engaged in the rich textures.</p>
<p>Track four is called <em>Cathedral</em>. Again everything is the same and everything is different, the guitar more skittish, the drone more plaintive, the space evoked by the field recordings more open and seeking, reaching more than circling. Rather than placing us in the intimate company of fellow creatures (birds, children), this track gives a sense of being in the presence of unseen events, of things moving we know not where. <em>Limestone</em>, the final track, wells up warmly, aswirl with crackling light and hope, and eddies us gently with harp-like flurries to a restful end.</p>
<p>And then comes the repeat button.</p>
<p>To say this is my favorite Wil Bolton album is already to say that I like it better than some of my favorite albums, period. I spent the summer wondering what would be high on of my end-of-year list &#8211; I had heard nice things this year, but nothing that had given me that sense that a magical gift had come my way. This is one of those gifts, and I am still gratefully falling in love with it.</p>
<p>I did not plan to write a review tonight. But the CD was playing and it caught me up and carried me along and I had to write&#8230;and fortunately the music is much better than my writing. Stream it below, buy it at Bandcamp and other online stores, luxuriate in it.</p>

<p>Germany&#8217;s Arovane has been putting out some striking ambient material of late, including the recent <a href="https://arovane.bandcamp.com/album/dwell-tevvel-structure" target="_blank">dwell_tevvel_structure</a> on the UK label <a href="http://www.txtrecordings.co.uk/" target="_blank">…txt recordings</a>. I have no idea what a <em>tevvel</em> is, and neither does Google; it&#8217;s an anagram of velvet and bears a passing resemblance to the Dutch teviel (&#8220;too much&#8221;), but who knows if that is relevant. <em>Dwelling</em>, in the sense of settling down and taking time, and <em>structure</em>, here in the form of careful layers of sound, are both terms that illuminate the music on this album. The album consists of four long sound pieces (ranging from 14 to 20 minutes), each with its own distinct character yet tied together sonically in an arc that suggests four movements of a whole. The first opens with a gently undulating drift and fluttering patters of brightness &#8211; perhaps it&#8217;s the cover art, but I find it hard not to think of sunlight sparkling on waves. <span id="more-5183"></span>The effect is relaxing and peaceful in the way the movement of a thousand leaves in a tree in sudden breeze is peaceful. The second track is more subdued, hushed, and grainy. Textured and smooth layers of sound take turns coming to the fore. After a while we are left with an airy but somber machine hum, until faint celestial tones begin to play at the edge of hearing, and almost imperceptibly the enveloping hum warms in tone until it slides into silence. The third track opens with a steady stream of deliciously layered sound, defying the ear to pick out all the strata &#8211; the tiny pulses, the fricative halo around the gentle rasp, the quiet hum, the resonant space around the sounds. The slightest changes come and go as the track streams onward, one of those quietly demanding pieces where nothing at all is happening until you really listen. The final track recalls the first, taking us back to bright open spaces and rushing flurries of sound, this time a little more buoyant and sharply accented. The whole work focuses on layering sound upon sound and giving the rich textures that cause time to stretch out and slowly unfold their different facets. There is lots to enjoy here for the patient listener.</p>

<p>Hot on the heels of that release comes a collaboration with Porya Hatami that has an entirely different feel. <a href="http://store.eter-lab.net/album/resonance" target="_blank" class="broken_link"><strong>Resonance</strong></a> (each track is named for a consecutive letter in the word) on Columbian <a href="http://store.eter-lab.net/music" target="_blank" class="broken_link">Éter records</a>, is darker, denser, a restlessly chattering conversation of small, dark sounds with some startling twists and turns. The album opens with a metallic glistening and an ominous hum, around which other fragments begin to bustle. Hatami&#8217;s releases have most often had a pastoral and rustic bent, but the world evoked here feels darker, more industrial, digital machines burbling and chiming in a cavernous, deserted factory. Things creak and stretch and tumble with resonant clatter as what sound like piano strings are struck, and strummed. A squelchy rhythm begins, haloed by a faint glow, before opening up into the album&#8217;s first contemplative stretch, a delicious blend of hum and hiss and tone that undulates gently for a while before sliding away into gentleness like waves receding. Then the computers are back to their grimly chiming cogitations, evolving into a nighttime jungle of electronic creatures. The electronic backdrop is joined by what sound more like actual bird calls, a dark machine world and nighttime nature merging before mournful strings emerge to add a human note to the scene. Drones layer into a glowing dawn, which abruptly ends in a brief and startling snatch of woozy jazz piano. The pattern of claustrophobically chittering machines, organic rustlings, and more peaceful, expansive tones repeats. As we reach the second N, ResonaNce, the world is brighter, more hopeful, burbling against crackling bright skies of sound. But then things turn ominous again, busy creaks and rustles return, like a wooden ship shifting darkly at its midnight mooring. The temperature drops and unseen presences whisper, until the woozy piano puts in a brief reprise, only to be overcome by a densely humming clatter. The whole is quite abstract and a little eerie, though not shapeless &#8211; a recurring strategy is to end busy pieces with brief closing sections that take them in quite different directions. A sense of being surrounded by small, unidentifiable events and uneasy dialogue between sound worlds makes for an album that is far from soothing but quite thought-provoking on close listening.</p>

<p>Swede Kristian Matsson has been making singer/songwriter folk as The Tallest Man on Earth since 2006, but <em>Dark Bird is Home</em> is easily his grandest.  Featuring a full band for the first time, including horns and even some electronics, Matsson has added a richness and depth to his music that often puts the album more in the vein of The Decemberists than his usual comparison of Bon Iver.  His true strength, however, remains as a poet, and the album is chock full of wordplay like &#8220;And I&#8217;ve already grown up here, here I might as well grow down&#8221; (from &#8220;Little Nowhere Towns&#8221;).  This combination of orchestration and lyrics makes <em>Dark Bird is Home</em> an absolute gem.<span id="more-5002"></span></p>

<p><strong>Blanck Mass &#8211; <em>Dumb Flesh</em></strong></p>
<p>A side project of Fuck Buttons&#8217; Benjamin John Power, Blanck Mass makes electronic post rock/drone that is more abstract than Power&#8217;s main group, but fans of Fuck Buttons will continue to find a lot to love on Blanck Mass&#8217; second release.  The album is largely made up of heavy drum machine, synth drones, and electronic chirps and flourishes, with label Sacred Bones <a href="http://www.sacredbonesrecords.com/products/sbr136-blanck-mass-dumb-flesh" target="_blank">describing it</a> as &#8220;a comment on the flaws of the human form in its current evolutionary state.&#8221; That&#8217;s an awful lot to glean from 53 minutes of instrumental experiments, but <em>Dumb Flesh</em> is nonetheless a seriously enjoyable listen even if its meaning is elusive.</p>

<p>Tacky, trashy, and scuzzy, Guantanamo Baywatch make surf, garage rock inspired by bands like The Trashmen, The Sonics, and The Cramps, and does so for one reason only: It&#8217;s fun.  <em>Darling&#8230;It&#8217;s Too Late</em> is the trio&#8217;s second widely available full length (although there are earlier recordings out there), and takes an &#8220;if it ain&#8217;t broke, don&#8217;t fix it&#8221; mentality to the group&#8217;s formula.  There&#8217;s reverb and lots of tenor on the guitars, vocal harmonies, and a rawness to the music that makes <em>Darling&#8230;It&#8217;s Too Late</em> perfect for hanging out on a summer&#8217;s day.</p>
<p>Also out today: Pfarmers &#8211; <em>Gunnera</em>, Snoop Dogg &#8211; <em>BUSH</em>, and Tyondai Braxton &#8211; <em>HIVE1</em>.</p>

<p>If there were questions as to the direction Sufjan Stevens would take after the departure from the norm that was <em>Age of Adz</em>, naming his new album after his mother and stepfather (his first album since his mother&#8217;s passing, mind you) answered those questions load and clear: Sufjan Stevens is looking back, which means a return to lovely, gentle indie folk.  <em>Carrie &amp; Lowell</em> strips away both the electronics of <em>Adz</em> and the lush orchestration of <em>Come on Feel the Illinoise</em>, putting the focus squarely on Sufjan&#8217;s lyrics, which come heavily from his life.  This album is going inspire a lot of reminiscing, particularly amongst those who have lost parents, and is going to cause a lot of tears.  They&#8217;ll be happy tears, though, so it&#8217;s unlikely people will be complaining. <span id="more-4962"></span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-march-31-2015/Godspeed-You-Black-Emperor-Asunder-Sweet-and-Other-Distress.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4963" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-march-31-2015/Godspeed-You-Black-Emperor-Asunder-Sweet-and-Other-Distress.jpg" alt="Godspeed You!

Black Emperor &#8211; <em>Asunder, Sweet and Other Distress</em></strong></p>
<p>Somewhere along the way, Godspeed You! Black Emperor&#8217;s post rock dropped its found sounds and more lighthearted moments, veering strongly to the drone end of the genre&#8217;s spectrum.  <em>Asunder, Sweet and Other Distress</em> continues the band&#8217;s exploration of that side of post rock.  The album is throbbing, foreboding, and everything you expect from GY!BE, but there is a surprising amount of light in these drones.  This is not an album that pummels you into submission through builds to overwhelming climaxes, rather it invites the listener to immerse themselves in the quieter moments with an almost hopeful feel that leaves the listener feeling legitimately joyful.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-march-31-2015/Lower-Dens-Escape-From-Evil.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4964" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-march-31-2015/Lower-Dens-Escape-From-Evil.jpg" alt="Lower Dens - Escape From Evil" width="280" height="280" srcset="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-march-31-2015/Lower-Dens-Escape-From-Evil.jpg 280w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-march-31-2015/Lower-Dens-Escape-From-Evil-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 280px) 100vw, 280px" /></a><strong>Lower Dens &#8211; <em>Escape From Evil</em></strong></p>
<p>Baltimore&#8217;s Lower Dens are a band on the rise.  In 2012 they released the excellent <em>Nootropics</em>, an album heavily indebted to shoegaze/dream pop sounds that would have fit in well on 4AD.  With <em>Escape From Evil</em>, however, they&#8217;re introducing a dancey, new wave feel to their music.  Drums and bass drive the songs on <em>Escape From Evil</em> and give the album a bounce that just hasn&#8217;t existed for the band before. Even with the new direction, however, the band&#8217;s music rises and falls with Jana Hunter&#8217;s strong alto vocals (reminiscent of Baltimore cohort Victoria Legrand of Beach House), and on this album there is far more rise than fall.</p>
