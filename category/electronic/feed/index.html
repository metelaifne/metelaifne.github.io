				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Can it be a year since the last list? Here goes with my favorite 20 releases of 2017. Your tastes are not mine, you will disagree, but maybe there is something here that you might not have discovered, something of beauty that might bring you joy. At one point I thought this might be a thin year; when I got down to making the list I realized there was no filler at the bottom. Exact placement is fuzzy – there are lots of apples and oranges being compared here. Feel free to move any of these up or down a few places in your head.</p>
<p><a href="https://12kmusic.bandcamp.com/album/somi"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5412" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/top-20-of-2017-david-smith/Somi-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="200" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/top-20-of-2017-david-smith/Somi-300x300.jpg 300w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/top-20-of-2017-david-smith/Somi-150x150.jpg 150w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/top-20-of-2017-david-smith/Somi.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" /></a><strong>#1. Taylor Deupree – Somi</strong></p>
<p>Deupree’s <em>Faint</em> from a few years ago is still one of my regular listens and pleasures, and I wonder with hindsight if I should have placed it at number one that year. He gave me another chance with the magnificent, meditative <em>Somi</em>. Loops of single notes from acoustic instruments played at varying intervals are layered and treated to create a fascinating slow dance of beauty and rest. And the deluxe edition packaging was as gorgeous as the music. (<a href="https://12kmusic.bandcamp.com/album/somi">Listen</a>)</p>

<p><strong>#2. Daniel Herskedal – The Roc</strong></p>
<p>Norwegian tubaist Herskedal’s new album adds an Arabic influence to his tuba-based jazz-folk explorations. The result is a unique, at times magical set of tunes high in atmosphere and richly colored. Several parts of this album stayed in my head all year. (<a href="https://danielherskedal.bandcamp.com/album/the-roc">Listen</a>)</p>

<p><a href="https://dronarivm.bandcamp.com/album/avifaunal"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5429" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/top-20-of-2017-david-smith/Pausal-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/top-20-of-2017-david-smith/Pausal-150x150.jpg 150w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/top-20-of-2017-david-smith/Pausal-300x300.jpg 300w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/top-20-of-2017-david-smith/Pausal-768x768.jpg 768w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/top-20-of-2017-david-smith/Pausal-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/top-20-of-2017-david-smith/Pausal.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>#3. Pausal – Avifaunal</strong></p>
<p>Pausal’s warm and finely textured drones have been growing on me the last few years. This year’s release took things up a notch, with a sweeping grandeur and narrative flow that make each minute count. An album to get lost in. (<a href="https://dronarivm.bandcamp.com/album/avifaunal">Listen</a>)</p>

<p><strong>#4. Anat Cohen Tentet – Happy Song</strong></p>
<p>The title and bright yellow cover are apt. New York-based Israeli clarinetist Cohen and her ensemble deliver a vibrantly grooving set of jazz romps that shift in character as the album progresses while maintaining an infectious sense of joy. (<a href="http://anzicstore.com/album/happy-song">Listen</a>)</p>

<p><strong>#5. Tinariwen – Elwan</strong></p>
<p>The Saharan blues return with the latest from the great Tuareg band, and it’s one of their finest. The sinuous, swaying rhythms undergird starkly poetic laments at the loss of social and environmental fabric.

<p><strong>#6. Seldom Sene Recorder Consort – Goldberg Variations</strong></p>
<p>As the title gives away, this is the Goldberg Variations played on recorders by a Dutch recorder consort. In addition to the virtuoso playing, the different sonorities of the wind instruments made the Goldbergs sparkle for me in a gentle and delightful new way.

<p><strong>#7. Otto A. Totland – The Lost</strong></p>
<p>Very similar in spirit to its predecessor, <em>Pinô</em>, this second album of piano solos again showcases Norwegian pianist Otto Totland’s ability to conjure a gentle, plaintive warmth through small melodies and soft sounds. (<a href="https://ottoatotland.bandcamp.com/">Listen</a>)</p>

<p><a href="https://chiheihatakeyama.bandcamp.com/album/sora"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5413" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/top-20-of-2017-david-smith/Sora-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/top-20-of-2017-david-smith/Sora-150x150.jpg 150w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/top-20-of-2017-david-smith/Sora-300x300.jpg 300w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/top-20-of-2017-david-smith/Sora-768x768.jpg 768w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/top-20-of-2017-david-smith/Sora-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/top-20-of-2017-david-smith/Sora.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>#8. Chihei Hatakeyama &amp; Federico Durand – Sora</strong></p>
<p>Combining Hatakeyama’s characteristic gossamer tonal washes and Durand’s delightfully pattering small sounds is a recipe for enormous prettiness, and that is just what we get on this deeply calming album. (<a href="https://chiheihatakeyama.bandcamp.com/album/sora">Listen</a>)</p>

<p><strong>#9. The Green Kingdom – The North Wind and the Sun</strong></p>
<p>The Green Kingdom has issued a long series of recordings offering an attractive world of delicate small sounds and textures. This release feels like something fresh as it bursts forth into uplifting melody thanks to the foregrounded guitar work.

<p><strong>#10. Emile Parisien, Vincent Peirani, Andreas Schaerer &amp; Michael Wollny – Out of Land</strong></p>
<p>An unusual but top-notch European jazz combo consisting of sax, accordion, piano, and vocalizations/beatboxing. The live recordings prickle with energy and abound in creativity, making for an exciting listen. (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAKio4qfeqM">Watch</a>)</p>

<p><strong>#11. Fieldhead – We’ve All Been Swimming</strong></p>
<p>Fieldhead’s latest is by far my favorite by the artist so far. It plays with odd rhythmic combinations, layering looping synth melodies over divergent rhythms. The result is a kind of mellow fascination, and great fun. (<a href="https://homeassemblymusic.bandcamp.com/album/weve-all-been-swimming">Listen</a>)</p>

<p><strong>#12. Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark – The Punishment of Luxury</strong></p>
<p>Not much pop makes my lists, but I loved OMD as a teen, and this new release sounds as if it could have been the immediate follow up to 1983’s <em>Dazzle Ships</em>. It nails what made their original Kraftwerk-with-soul sound special, and that made me grin. (<a href="https://officialomd.bandcamp.com/releases">Listen</a>)</p>

<p><strong>#13. Rudresh Mahanthappa/Indo-Pak Coalition – Agrima </strong></p>

<p><strong>#14. Helge Lien Trio – Guzuguzu</strong></p>
<p>With track titles drawn from Japanese onomatopoeia, Helge Lien’s latest piano trio album is made up of moody evocations of atmosphere and movement, often skirting around song structures. Sparkling piano breaks through like rays of sunlight. (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u8uNWIroJQ">Watch</a>)</p>

<p><strong>#15. Porya Hatami – Monads</strong></p>
<p>When I posted my review of this to Facebook none of my friends hit “like,” and it is admittedly a pretty abstract set of experiments with sound rather than a collection of tunes. But they are fascinating experiments, glimpses into the push-and-pull of forces that make the world a place with sound.

<p><strong>#16. Yazz Ahmed – La Saboteuse</strong></p>
<p>Ahmed is a British-Bahraini trumpeter who here successfully melds Arabic motifs, electronic treatments, and jazz trumpet in a set of beguiling tunes. (<a href="https://yazzahmed.bandcamp.com/album/la-saboteuse-2">Listen</a>)</p>

<p><strong>#17. Alea Saxophone Quartet – Arvo Pärt: Anima</strong></p>
<p>If the idea of Pärt played on saxophones conjures up a mental collision of ethereal voices and ill-chosen skronking, think again. The pure tones and harmonies of the sax quartet evocatively capture the spirit of Pärt’s austere choral pieces. (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjbB3NPiL1QTbsipfDysz0M1KRCfMzeLD">Listen</a>)</p>

<p><strong>#18. Taylor Deupree &amp; Marcus Fischer – Lowlands</strong></p>
<p>Building on previous outings as a duo, Deupree and Fischer again show a mastery of the microscopic world of small resonances, adding another delightful release to their growing oeuvre. (<a href="https://12kmusic.bandcamp.com/album/lowlands">Listen</a>)</p>

<p><strong>#19. Brot &amp; Sterne – Tales of Herbst</strong></p>
<p>This was not quite like anything else I listened to, which is perhaps not surprising in the case of a hurdy-gurdy/hang drum/trumpet jazz trio. The improvised instrumentals set warmly tuneful passages amid unique and atmospheric textures. (<a href="https://brotundsterne.bandcamp.com/releases">Listen</a>)</p>

<p><strong>#20. Billow Observatory – II: Plains/Patterns </strong></p>
<p>More active than their debut release, this collection of ambient pieces pulses and shimmers airily. Enjoyable throughout. (<a href="https://billowobservatory.bandcamp.com/album/ii-plains-patterns">Listen</a>)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>The next 10&#8230;</strong></p>
<p>And here are ten more that I had a really hard time cutting to get the list down to 20. Some of these jumped in and out of my list several times, and might have made it if I had finalized the list tomorrow. Alphabetically:</p>
<p>Wil Bolton – Night Paths (Ambient)</p>
<p>Bruce Cockburn – Bone on Bone (Folk)</p>
<p>Marcus Fischer – Loss (Ambient)</p>
<p>From the Mouth of the Sun – Hymn Binding (Modern Classical)</p>
<p>Ian Hawgood &amp; Wil Bolton – Transparencies (Ambient)</p>
<p>Hudson – Hudson (Jazz)</p>
<p>Rafael Anton Irisarri – The Shameless Years (Ambient)</p>
<p>Benedikt Jahnel Trio – The Invariant (Piano jazz)</p>
<p>Darren McClure – Nature Mirror (Ambient)</p>
<p>Phronesis, Julian Argüelles, &amp; Frankfurt Radio Big Band – The Behemoth (Jazz)</p>
<p>As ever, if any of the artists happen by, thank you for another year of inspiring music.</p>

<p>Here is the mystery of <a href="https://lineimprint.bandcamp.com/album/monads"><em>Monads</em></a>. It is, by design, not an album of tunes, or even of nice, appealing drones. It is a collection of experiments in sound design, playing with frequencies and the odd bulges, strange eruptions, and frayed edges that emerge when sound itself is subjected to expert duress. It appears on the LINE label, which specializes in rarified noises that would puzzle many of my friends. It is an album that, save for one track, might be a shock to the system of anyone who comes to it from the melodic, pastoral beauty of a previous Hatami album such as <a href="http://noise.poryahatami.com/album/shallow"><em>Shallow</em></a>. It is the kind of album where the review ought to be about all the special equipment and arcane techniques employed to wrestle the novel sounds out of the ether.</p>
<p><span id="more-5399"></span></p>
<p>And yet….and yet it remains strangely musical, an album to which I find myself returning more than I thought I might. It evokes an enduring fascination. And that gets me wondering again what it is about recordings that most of my relatives would not concede to be music that nevertheless draws me in.</p>
<p>It helps that the sounds, odd, abstract, and alienated as they are, are never grating. The tonalities generated are varied, organic, and interesting and often in their own way winsome and tuneful, like an alien orchestra making music that escapes our cultural horizons. The soundscape is strange, but not creepy – only <em>7 (Verblendungszusammenhang)</em> sounds anxious. (At least to my ear; I have learned that the threshold of other family members can differ from mine.) <em>8 (Kurdish Folk Song)</em> is rather beautiful in texture and indeed somewhat song-like, provided the song is sung by space whales in the subterranean oceans of a moon orbiting Jupiter. It leaves me with a sense of wonder. The first key, then, is just to listen with attentive and open ears to the sounds themselves as they prance and swoop and loom, and to enjoy the specific pleasure of their textures, even as they sound like nothing at all but themselves.</p>
<p>And then, along with the textures, there is the ongoing sense of churning, wandering movement. There are, no beats or regular rhythms, yet nothing is still and the nature of the movement keeps shifting not only between, but within tracks. Take <em>3A</em>, a track that burbles forcefully with barely audible deep frequencies and bubbles insistently with a kind of turbulent air pressure. There is indeed no narrative, but there is a sense of life, of urgency, of something stirring in the depths. The next track, 3B, keeps a murmur of the deep but shifts the focus into the buzzing air, stuttering firefly-like over a calming hum as odd whistles swoop in obscure squiggles. The background of hiss of <em>4 (Phonetic)</em> reminds me of a river heard in the middle distance, but in the foreground percussive gusts swirl; after a while a rather train-like rhythm appears, and deforms, and vanishes again, too brief and abstracted to seem referential, yet nevertheless a moment where something familiar-seeming rises from the mist. The opening turbulence of <em>6A</em> might sit somewhere between the howling of winds and of creatures, yet the closing section feels more like a lap steel guitar played by zephyrs.</p>
<p>I do not mean to suggest that the album is programmatic, or to impose my own mind’s groping for this-worldly points of reference onto the material. I do not at all have the impression that the sounds are actually meant to paint objects in the world. And yet in their laying bare of primal sonic layers they at times feel like archetypes, evocations of a kind of basic energy trying to take form, evocations that speak of the ways that such energy swirls or buffets, howls or hums, looms or stutters in the fabric of reality. And in this sense the various sounds do feel to me rooted in the world. I am left thinking that if the album is about anything it is about the glories to be found in sound itself, in the myriad ways that energy can move through molecules and make beauty, ways hardly exhausted by all the more conventional tunes ever written.</p>
<p>Released back in April, Monads is not the most accessible Porya Hatami recording, but it may be one of his best. Check it out on <a href="http://www.lineimprint.com/">LINE</a> and stream it at <a href="https://lineimprint.bandcamp.com/album/monads">Bandcamp</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As I prepared <a href="http://musicisgood.org/2016/12/top-20-of-2016-david-smith/">this year&#8217;s top 20 list</a>, I discovered that several of my favorite releases this year were not full albums, but brief EPs. Including them in the top 20 albums list felt a bit like trying to compare novels and short stories, so I decided to list them separately. These were my top 5 favorite EPs of 2016:</p>

<p><strong><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5361" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/top-20-of-2016-david-smith/Pjusk-Syklus-150x150.jpg" alt="pjusk-syklus" width="150" height="150" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/top-20-of-2016-david-smith/Pjusk-Syklus-150x150.jpg 150w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/top-20-of-2016-david-smith/Pjusk-Syklus-300x300.jpg 300w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/top-20-of-2016-david-smith/Pjusk-Syklus.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" />#1. <a href="https://pjusk.bandcamp.com/album/syklus">Pjusk &#8211; Syklus</a></strong><br />
A wonderful surprise at the end of the year: three Pjusk collaborations. Loscil, Porya Hatami, and SHAO add their musical perspectives, and the distinctive sound of Pjusk remains present in each track. Brilliant stuff.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><br />
<img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5360" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/top-20-of-2016-david-smith/bolton-lichen-150x150.jpg" alt="bolton-lichen" width="150" height="150" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/top-20-of-2016-david-smith/bolton-lichen-150x150.jpg 150w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/top-20-of-2016-david-smith/bolton-lichen-300x300.jpg 300w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/top-20-of-2016-david-smith/bolton-lichen.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" />#2. <a href="https://wilbolton.bandcamp.com/album/lichen">Wil Bolton &#8211; Lichen</a></strong><br />
Fifteen minutes of warm, spacious, crackly, resonant, luxuriant sound. My favorite of Wil Bolton&#8217;s several releases this year. Check out his <a href="https://wilbolton.bandcamp.com/album/maemi"><em>Maemi</em></a> EP and the full-length <em><a href="https://wilbolton.bandcamp.com/album/february-dawn">February Dawn</a> </em>as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5362" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/top-20-of-2016-david-smith/Kyoka-sh-150x150.jpg" alt="kyoka-sh" width="150" height="150" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/top-20-of-2016-david-smith/Kyoka-sh-150x150.jpg 150w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/top-20-of-2016-david-smith/Kyoka-sh-300x300.jpg 300w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/top-20-of-2016-david-smith/Kyoka-sh.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /><strong>#3. <a href="https://boomkat.com/products/sh-51bef2ef-bcbb-42cd-9e10-a427ff8bdb04">Kyoka &#8211; SH</a></strong><br />
My list had its share of gentleness this year, but for moments when something more hard-edged fit the bill, this short collection of rumbling minimalist techno in the classic raster-noton vein was an excellent stand-by.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><br />
<img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5363" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/top-20-of-2016-david-smith/Murcof-EP01-150x150.jpg" alt="murcof-ep01" width="150" height="150" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/top-20-of-2016-david-smith/Murcof-EP01-150x150.jpg 150w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/top-20-of-2016-david-smith/Murcof-EP01-300x300.jpg 300w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/top-20-of-2016-david-smith/Murcof-EP01.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" />#4. <a href="https://infine-rec.bandcamp.com/album/ep01">Murcof and Vanessa Wagner &#8211; EP01</a></strong><br />
By turns darkly brooding and gently melancholy, this turbulent-electronics-meets-Satie release stuck with me even after the full-length album that followed it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5364" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/top-20-of-2016-david-smith/Jazzdefector-150x150.jpg" alt="jazzdefector" width="150" height="150" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/top-20-of-2016-david-smith/Jazzdefector-150x150.jpg 150w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/top-20-of-2016-david-smith/Jazzdefector-300x300.jpg 300w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/top-20-of-2016-david-smith/Jazzdefector.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /><strong>#5. <a href="https://audiogourmet.bandcamp.com/album/miniatures">Jazzdefector &#8211; Miniatures</a></strong></p>
<p>Finally, something more relaxing. A series of very short pieces of effects-laden guitar offer a summery interlude, warm and pretty.</p>

I excluded compilations (though <a href="http://shop.serein.co.uk/album/orbital-planes-passenger-trains-vol-1"><em>Orbital Planes &amp; Passenger Trains, Vol. 1</em></a> from Serein, <a href="https://dronarivm.bandcamp.com/album/into-the-white-new-years-2016-free-compilation"><em>Into the White</em></a> from Dronarivm, and <a href="https://www.fat-cat.co.uk/release/eleven-into-fifteen-a-130701-compilation"><em>Eleven into Fifteen</em></a> from 130701 all delighted me). As ever, this is the best in my subjective judgment of what I heard and liked, no more, and the numbering is less important than the chance of helping someone find something good that they missed. This year I am treating EPs separately, <a href="http://musicisgood.org/?p=5331&#038;preview=true">in a second post</a>.<span id="more-5329"></span></p>

<p><strong>#1.</strong> <a href="https://federicodurand.bandcamp.com/album/a-trav-s-del-espejo"><strong>Federico Durand – A Través Del Espejo</strong></a><br />
This delightful album was released on 12k early in the year, and I kept listening to it all year. (My wife liked it too, which is far from guaranteed with the more experimental fringes of my listening.) A childlike celebration of tiny, fragile sounds, and a reminder of what can be destroyed by noise and bombast, this album offers a series of delicate meditations on the vulnerable beauty of sound. Durand&#8217;s <a href="https://federicodurand.bandcamp.com/"><em>Jardín de invierno</em></a> (on Spekk) deserves honorable mention in the same vein, but it was this earlier release that captivated my ears the most this year.</p>

<p><strong>#2. <a href="https://play.spotify.com/album/2EvZiOMBlC9b5hbjbZCjZv?play=true&#038;utm_source=open.spotify.com&#038;utm_medium=open">Nicolas Jaar &#8211; Sirens</a></strong><br />
The haunting first track displays magnificently Jaar&#8217;s precise mastery of his palette of sounds. The album continues with a compelling sideways take on a variety of song forms, with the thematic focus on a culture of political violence providing a dark textual undercurrent. A remarkable piece of work, whether one focuses on the catchy songs, on the textual warnings, or on the meticulously shaped sonic shifts.</p>

<p>#<strong>3. <a href="https://kaitlynaureliasmith.bandcamp.com/album/frkwys-vol-13-sunergy">Kaitlyn Aurelia Smith &amp; Suzanne Ciani &#8211; Sunergy</a></strong><br />
An inspired set of Buchla synthesizer improvisations from a senior master of the art and a new rising star (Smith&#8217;s solo album <a href="https://kaitlynaureliasmith.bandcamp.com/album/ears"><em>Ears</em></a> this year was also excellent). Sequences burble and sparkle over shifting hums and currents, providing a compelling update to the long-form analog synthesizer genre.</p>

What if Brian Eno&#8217;s classic ambient work, <em>Music for Airports,</em> were recorded as a jazz album? Chris Schlarb showed us this year that the results could be very enjoyable indeed. We also get a new, complementary piece, the &#8220;working man&#8217;s counterpart&#8221; to music for airports titled &#8220;Music for Bus Stops.&#8221; Both pieces charmed me.</p>

An acoustic guitar meanders gently and peacefully as an unsettled bed of chirping, buzzing, warbling, squeaking electronics chatters tensely alongside, setting up a fascinating conversation that sometimes produces tension, sometimes converges.</p>

Ostermeier &#8211; Tiny Birds</a></strong><br />
Building on last year&#8217;s <em>Still</em>, M. Ostermeier returned with an aptly titled collection of short, plaintive piano pieces. Accompanied by background rustles and rattles, the tracks are sparse, stark, melancholy, almost hesitant in their deliberation. The sound is intimate, inviting us to slow down and attend rather than carrying us along.</p>

David Newman&#8217;s recent releases have struck an absorbing balance between experimental exploration of the properties of sound and a melodic presence, and this collaboration with Justin Varis continues in the same rich vein. Remixes by various luminaries of the genre add a further dimension to this charming collection of off-kilter pieces.</p>

Korwar takes field recordings of folk music from Indian villages and marries them with jazz and electronics so skilfully that it is hard to see the joins. Raw recordings of chant and percussion from India provide the substrate that morphs into engaging jazz sequences that extend the sources without leaving them behind. A striking, unusual release.</p>

Loscil continues to find new angles on his distinctive sound, and his latest contains some of his most aggressive rhythms to date. It also serves up a fresh helping of his signature hypnotically shimmering pulses. I have never met a Loscil album I didn&#8217;t like, and this latest release more than kept the streak going.</p>

Resonant guitar notes follow one another at a gentle, leisurely pace. An ethereal atmosphere builds amid their resonance. Chiming rhythms eventually arrive, but only accentuate the calm. The album drifts by lazily, a slow caress.</p>

An evocative follow-up to Tiento de las Nieves, Tiento de la Luz offers a glacially paced interaction of piano, viola da gamba, and electronics. As usual with Köner, deep frequencies and extended textures play an important role, with the decay of each note held before us for contemplation. Mesmerizing listening.</p>

<p><strong>#12. <a href="https://slaapwel.bandcamp.com/album/filament">Gareth Davis &#8211; Filament</a></strong><br />
A rich, undulating, 35-minute drone, embedded in field recordings of the ocean, gains texture from the use of bass and contrabass clarinet along with electronics. Deep rumbles and whale-song-like squeaks ebb, and flow, and sway to deeply atmospheric effect.</p>

<p>The Native American sonic references may be a little hokey here and there, but the more I listened to this release from French jazz bass veteran Henri Texier the more the tunes sank their hooks into me. The live reprise released later in the year, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dakota-Mab-Live-Theater-G-tersloh/dp/B01CORX2WE/ref=tmm_msc_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&#038;qid=&#038;sr=" class="broken_link"><em>Dakota Mab</em></a>, is worth a listen too.</p>

<p>Piano again, now heard through a rich haze of sonic manipulation, tinkling amid a crackle and rush of air, emerging from a busy hum, chiming like bells, meandering sadly, punctuating an ominous buzz. Porya Hatami and Uwe Zahn keep shifting the sonic palette a little, crowding the electronic atmosphere with portent as the piano soldiers bravely on.</p>

This is not background music. It seems at any given moment as if little is happening, yet the whole unfolds in a way that feels tautly dramatic, like a small movie made of slight violin scrapes, hisses, metallic reverberations, wordless vocalizations, the sounds of something important happening, just over the horizon and almost out of earshot.</p>

Nils Frahm got together with some childhood friends to revisit and remix some tapes they had made decades ago. The result is a collection of atmospheric lo-fi instrumentals that somehow manage to sound reminiscent of Frahm&#8217;s solo work while being little like his previous material in form.</p>

McClure trades more in precise measures of sound than in tunes. Each track on this immersive, painstakingly crafted album invites the listener to meditate on a specific quality of carefully constructed sound, ranging from the nature-tinged water-and-hum of the opening track to almost-not-there gossamer drones and unexpected pulses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

There are stretches in which this album sounds like a gaggle of synthesizers improvising by themselves, without human intervention. Bright, chiming sounds ripple and cascade merrily. Stick around, though, and the two long pieces begin to develop and morph, building into rich swathes of sound.</p>

Drone and noise, crackle and hum, chaotic dissolution of sound and a massive sense of grandeur &#8211; these are the basic building blocks of <em>Continuum</em>. Jebanasam sets out to capture &#8220;the spectrum of life, power and energy present in the universe&#8221; and emerges with a dramatic set of drone compositions.</p>

The practically ungooglable title gave me some trouble tracking down this unusual release. It began from recordings of the sounds of bees in their hives and built instrumental compositions around the bee drones and buzzes. The music is pastoral, and the interweaving of natural and instrumental sounds is quite sensitively done.</p>

<p>Saw a lot of live music this year, with well over 100 different bands represented.  These were the best of the bunch:<span id="more-5319"></span></p>
<p class="UFICommentBody _1n4g"><strong>15. <span data-ft="{&quot;tn&quot;:&quot;K&quot;}"><span class="UFICommentBody _1n4g">Wand: November 5, 2015 &#8211; 7th Street Entry</span></span></strong></p>
<p class="UFICommentBody _1n4g">Wand showed up in the Entry and blew the doors off the place.  A technically very talented band, Wand is able to transfer their skills from the studio to the stage better than a vast majority of similar bands.</p>
<p><strong>14. <span data-ft="{&quot;tn&quot;:&quot;K&quot;}"><span class="UFICommentBody _1n4g">Miguel: August 15, 2015 &#8211; State Theater</span></span></strong></p>
<p>Miguel is an incredible performer with magnificent stage presence.  His only real negative is a tendency towards unnecessary, and eye rolling, preachiness.  The show was moved from First Avenue due to a ceiling collapse, otherwise it would likely rank higher.</p>
<p><strong>13. <span data-ft="{&quot;tn&quot;:&quot;K&quot;}"><span class="UFICommentBody _1n4g">White Lung: June 11, 2015 &#8211; 7th Street Entry</span></span></strong></p>
<p>There are few things in this world as invigorating as a truly blazing punk show, and White Lung qualifies.  Mish Way is a banshee of a frontwoman, and the band absolutely crushed it.</p>
<p><strong>12. <span data-ft="{&quot;tn&quot;:&quot;K&quot;}"><span class="UFICommentBody _1n4g">Hot Chip: May 30, 2015 &#8211; First Avenue</span></span></strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s difficult to comprehend the vast number of great songs in Hot Chip&#8217;s catalog until you hear them all at the same time.  It makes for a seriously fun show, especially when capped off by a Springsteen cover.</p>
<p><strong>11. <span data-ft="{&quot;tn&quot;:&quot;K&quot;}"><span class="UFICommentBody _1n4g">TV on the Radio: July 30, 2015 &#8211; First Avenue</span></span></strong></p>
<p>TV on the Radio doesn&#8217;t mess around with gimmicks.  They just take the stage and rock the audience&#8217;s socks off.  In this instance, however, they did close with one of the best of the many &#8216;Purple Rain&#8217; covers played in the Mainroom.</p>
<p><strong>10. <span data-ft="{&quot;tn&quot;:&quot;K&quot;}"><span class="UFICommentBody _1n4g">Vince Staples: December 13, 2015 &#8211; Fine Line</span></span></strong></p>
<p>On <em>Summertime &#8217;06</em>, Vince Staples comes across as a survivor.  He&#8217;s a guy who can grow up surrounded by pain, but make it through.  In concert it becomes clear that in addition to this, he&#8217;s a truly funny guy, and the combination of humor and pain makes for a fascinating show.</p>
<p><strong>9. <span data-ft="{&quot;tn&quot;:&quot;K&quot;}"><span class="UFICommentBody _1n4g">Algiers: June 16, 2015 &#8211; Triple Rock</span></span></strong></p>
<p>Algiers played this show before about 30 people, but you wouldn&#8217;t have known it from their performance.  The energy level was off the charts (especially from bassist Ryan Mahan), which added to the already existing urgency in the band&#8217;s gospel, post punk.</p>
<p><strong>8. <span data-ft="{&quot;tn&quot;:&quot;K&quot;}"><span class="UFICommentBody _1n4g">Titus Andronicus: October 9, 2015 &#8211; Triple Rock</span></span></strong></p>
<p>One of the best rock bands going right now, Titus Andronicus always brings it live, and the TMLT tour was no exception (even if they were distracted by the Mets in the World Series).  A great rock show with a crowd that couldn&#8217;t get enough.</p>
<p><strong>7. <span data-ft="{&quot;tn&quot;:&quot;K&quot;}"><span class="UFICommentBody _1n4g">The Replacements: May 2, 2015 &#8211; The Rave</span></span></strong></p>
<p>A ballroom in Milwaukee is no Midway Stadium filled to bursting, but any opportunity to see Paul Westerberg, Tommy Stinson, and crew play those songs is a gift.  Sadly we might have seen the last of The Mats.</p>
<p><strong>6. <span data-ft="{&quot;tn&quot;:&quot;K&quot;}"><span class="UFICommentBody _1n4g">Big Star&#8217;s Third: September 30, 2015 &#8211; First Avenue</span></span></strong></p>
<p>A performance of Big Star&#8217;s <em>Third</em>, plus the &#8216;hits,&#8217; featuring Big Star&#8217;s Jody Stephenson, The dB&#8217;s Chris Stamey, The Posies&#8217; Ken Stringfellow, R.E.M.&#8217;s Mike Mills, and many, many others. It was an absolute joy to hear this songs live.</p>
<p><strong>5. <span data-ft="{&quot;tn&quot;:&quot;K&quot;}"><span class="UFICommentBody _1n4g">Run the Jewels: October 23, 2015 &#8211; First Avenue</span></span></strong></p>
<p>RtJ has done basically the same show for the last two years, but it doesn&#8217;t matter.  The energy and comradery between Killer Mike and El-P is overwhelming and infectious.  Add that to the fire that is RtJ songs, and it&#8217;s a great night no matter how many times you&#8217;ve seen it.</p>
<p><strong>4. <span data-ft="{&quot;tn&quot;:&quot;K&quot;}"><span class="UFICommentBody _1n4g">Stevie Wonder: March 29, 2015 &#8211; Target Center</span></span></strong></p>
<p>Stevie Wonder brought more than 40 musicians to the stage, including India.Arie, and performed <em>Songs in the Key of Life</em> in its entirety before finishing with some hits, including a show stopping performance of &#8220;Superstition&#8221;.  If it hadn&#8217;t been in an arena this would be #1 by far.</p>
<p><strong>3. <span data-ft="{&quot;tn&quot;:&quot;K&quot;}"><span class="UFICommentBody _1n4g">Kraftwerk: October 7, 2015 &#8211; Northrop</span></span></strong></p>
<p>Four old German guys in funny spandex outfits standing in front of early 80s 3D technology shouldn&#8217;t be great, but it absolutely is.  Then they brought out the robots.  Kraftwerk are true legends and they do what they do very, very well.</p>
<p><strong><span data-ft="{&quot;tn&quot;:&quot;K&quot;}"><span class="UFICommentBody _1n4g">2. Sleater-Kinney: February 14, 2015 &#8211; First Avenue</span></span></strong></p>
<p>They haven&#8217;t lost anything.  Carrie Brownstein still wails on the guitar while doing high kicks, Janet Weiss still crushes the drums, and Corin Tucker&#8217;s voice might be better than ever (she was especially devastating on &#8220;Gimme Love&#8221;).  The crowd was in ecstasy throughout.</p>
<p><strong><span data-ft="{&quot;tn&quot;:&quot;K&quot;}"><span class="UFICommentBody _1n4g">1. Father John Misty: April 4, 2015 &#8211; First Avenue</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span data-ft="{&quot;tn&quot;:&quot;K&quot;}"><span class="UFICommentBody _1n4g">The hype surrounding a Father John Misty live show is immense.  It would be very easy for Josh Tillman to dial it back a bit and still leave the crowd happy, but he refuses to do so.  He puts absolutely everything he has into every note, every gesture, and every word with the crowd.  It&#8217;s a remarkable thing to witness, and if you haven&#8217;t yet done so, you must.<br />

<p><strong>24. Speedy Ortiz – <em>Foil Deer</em></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-april-21-2015/Speedy-Ortiz-Foil-Deer.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-4976"><img class="alignleft wp-image-4976 size-thumbnail" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-april-21-2015/Speedy-Ortiz-Foil-Deer-150x150.jpg" alt="Speedy Ortiz - Foil Deer" width="150" height="150" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-april-21-2015/Speedy-Ortiz-Foil-Deer-150x150.jpg 150w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-april-21-2015/Speedy-Ortiz-Foil-Deer.jpg 280w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a>Speedy Ortiz’s previous releases were enjoyable, but often lacked the hooks to take the band to the next level.  <em>Foil Deer</em> does not have that deficiency. It has hooks for days.  Sadie Dupuis’ voice and the album’s guitar tones bring to mind 90s artists like Liz Phair and Veruca Salt, but <em>Foil Deer</em> is noise pop for this generation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>22. Young Thug – <em>Barter 6</em></strong></p>

It’s hooky, full of intricate flows and odd bars, and of course features Thugga’s distinctive voice.  Where this tape stands out among Thug&#8217;s output of the last couple years, however, is the production.  The beats here are almost languid and Thug’s flow often slows down to ride in the pocket.</p>

Even with the new direction, however, the band’s music rises and falls with Jana Hunter’s strong alto vocals, and <em>Escape From Evil</em> has far more rise than fall.</p>

<p><strong>5. Colleen Green – <em>I Want to Grow Up</em></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-25-of-2015-craig-mcmanus/Colleen-Green-I-Want-to-Grow-Up.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-5265"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5265" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-25-of-2015-craig-mcmanus/Colleen-Green-I-Want-to-Grow-Up-150x150.jpg" alt="Colleen Green - I Want to Grow Up" width="150" height="150" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-25-of-2015-craig-mcmanus/Colleen-Green-I-Want-to-Grow-Up-150x150.jpg 150w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-25-of-2015-craig-mcmanus/Colleen-Green-I-Want-to-Grow-Up-300x300.jpg 300w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-25-of-2015-craig-mcmanus/Colleen-Green-I-Want-to-Grow-Up.jpg 425w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a>Colleen Green has been making her version of Southern California slacker, garage pop for a while now, and she may have perfected it with <em>I Want to Grow Up</em>.  Lyrically, the album speaks to a generational resignation to a life of underachievement and boredom, but it&#8217;s also really catchy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>4. Grimes –<em> Art Angels</em></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-25-of-2015-craig-mcmanus/Grimes-Art-Angels.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-5263"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5263" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-25-of-2015-craig-mcmanus/Grimes-Art-Angels-150x150.jpg" alt="Grimes - Art Angels" width="150" height="150" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-25-of-2015-craig-mcmanus/Grimes-Art-Angels-150x150.jpg 150w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-25-of-2015-craig-mcmanus/Grimes-Art-Angels.jpg 280w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a>Grimes scared a lot of people with some of the singles she released after the fantastic <em>Visions</em>, but there was no need to worry.  <em>Art Angels</em> is more towards the pop end of the experimental pop spectrum, but it still contains that ineffable Claire Boucher quality that makes her music great.  About that cover, though&#8230;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>3. Titus Andronicus – <em>The Most Lamentable Tragedy</em></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/the-new-music-friday-3-for-july-31-2015/Titus-Andronicus-The-Most-Lamentable-Tragedy.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-5176"><img class="alignleft wp-image-5176 size-thumbnail" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/the-new-music-friday-3-for-july-31-2015/Titus-Andronicus-The-Most-Lamentable-Tragedy-150x150.jpg" alt="Titus Andronicus - The Most Lamentable Tragedy" width="150" height="150" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/the-new-music-friday-3-for-july-31-2015/Titus-Andronicus-The-Most-Lamentable-Tragedy-150x150.jpg 150w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/the-new-music-friday-3-for-july-31-2015/Titus-Andronicus-The-Most-Lamentable-Tragedy.jpg 280w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a></p>
<p><em>The Most Lamentable Tragedy</em> may not be Titus Andronicus’ best album, but due to its in-depth focus on mental illness it is easily their most important.  The lyrics, dark and beautiful, despairing and hopeful, are what frontman Patrick Stickles has been building towards for his entire career, and are devastatingly important.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2. Vince Staples – <em>Summertime ‘06</em></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-june-30-2015/Vince-Staples-Summertime-06.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-5155"><img class="alignleft wp-image-5155 size-thumbnail" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-june-30-2015/Vince-Staples-Summertime-06-150x150.jpg" alt="Vince Staples - Summertime '06" width="150" height="150" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-june-30-2015/Vince-Staples-Summertime-06-150x150.jpg 150w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-june-30-2015/Vince-Staples-Summertime-06.jpg 280w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a><em>Summertime ’06</em> is an entry into a 13-year old Staples’ world trying to navigate growing up on the L.A. streets.  Not an original concept, of course, but unlike its predecessors it neither thrives in the gangsta life nor chafes against it.  <em>Summertime ’06</em> simply tries to survive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>1. Kendrick Lamar – <em>To Pimp a Butterfly</em></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-march-17-2015/Kendrick-Lamar-To-Pimp-a-Butterfly-e1426606842101.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-4951"><img class="alignleft wp-image-4951 size-thumbnail" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-march-17-2015/Kendrick-Lamar-To-Pimp-a-Butterfly-150x150.jpg" alt="Kendrick Lamar - To Pimp a Butterfly" width="150" height="150" /></a><em>To Pimp a Butterfly</em> is an absolute monster.  Simultaneously a declaration of being a proud black man and a declaration of war against the socio-economic situation so many face in American society.  It’s the most daringly political album in some time, and it is jawdroppingly amazing.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here is my top 20 music releases for 2015, with no claim that they are somehow objectively the best or that I listened to everything anyone else did. I have found things that delighted me on other people’s lists, and the point of the exercise is not to replicate or compete with those lists but to highlight some things you may not have found, things that might delight you. The sequence changed every time I made a shortlist, so take the numbers with a pinch of salt – all of them could be at least plus or minus 5 on a given day.<span id="more-5218"></span></p>
<p><img class="alignleft wp-image-5195" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/review-inscriptions-by-wil-bolton/Inscriptions-150x150.jpg" alt="Inscriptions" width="200" height="200" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/review-inscriptions-by-wil-bolton/Inscriptions-150x150.jpg 150w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/review-inscriptions-by-wil-bolton/Inscriptions.jpg 280w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>#1.</strong> <strong>Wil Bolton – Inscriptions</strong><br />
I have loved many of Wil Bolton’s releases, and this one was especially captivating, a cohesive suite of carefully textured ambient soundscapes of great warmth and delicacy. A delight for the ears from start to finish. Full review <a href="http://musicisgood.org/2015/12/review-inscriptions-by-wil-bolton/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5234" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Nils-Frahm-150x150.jpg" alt="Nils Frahm" width="150" height="150" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Nils-Frahm-150x150.jpg 150w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Nils-Frahm-300x300.jpg 300w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Nils-Frahm.jpg 512w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>#2. Nils Frahm – Solo</strong><br />
Nils Frahm has had a prolific year, including a film score and electronic duets with Ólafur Arnalds, but where he remains unrivaled is as a painter of fragile intimacy on the piano. This collection of solo piano pieces did not disappoint, offering both slow affection and rhythmic drive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5233" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Kari-Ikonen-150x150.jpg" alt="Kari Ikonen" width="150" height="150" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Kari-Ikonen-150x150.jpg 150w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Kari-Ikonen.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>#<strong>3. Kari Ikonen Trio &#8211; Beauteous Tales and Offbeat Stories</strong><br />
From scampering piano romps to meditative arco bass passages, from stately melodies to discordant experimental interludes, this album charms with its variety and adds another thread to my fondness for Scandinavian piano jazz.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5229" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Hatami-mcclure-150x150.jpg" alt="Hatami mcclure" width="150" height="150" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Hatami-mcclure-150x150.jpg 150w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Hatami-mcclure.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" />#4. Porya Hatami and Darren Mcclure – In-Between Spaces</strong><br />
A delicious marriage of McClure’s abstract tones and Hatami’s gently burbling textures, this joint essay in textured ambiance is gently reflective in mood, a continual, fragile, questing movement within a basic rest. Another excellent release for Hatami, and a fine companion to McClure’s excellent Primary Locations from earlier in the year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5225" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Den-Sorte-Skole-150x150.jpg" alt="Den Sorte Skole" width="150" height="150" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Den-Sorte-Skole-150x150.jpg 150w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Den-Sorte-Skole.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" />#5. Den Sorte Skole – Indians and Cowboys</strong><br />
Den Sorte Skole take thousands of small samples from old vinyl records and weave them into eclectic tapestries in which they become a cohesive, dappled, new whole. An unerring sense of groove is married to sounds and voices from the past and around the world. Get it for free at the artists’ site <a href="http://densorteskole.net/">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5227" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Esmerine-150x150.jpg" alt="Esmerine" width="150" height="150" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Esmerine-150x150.jpg 150w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Esmerine.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" />#6. Esmerine &#8211; Lost Voices</strong><br />
Marimba, percussion and strings are the backbone of Esmerine’s moody miniatures. The music sometimes shares the ponderous majesty of related bands godspeed you! black emperor and Thee Silver Mt. Zion, but its idiom is more acoustic, rooted in marimba, strings and drums. Lost Voices builds gentle rhythms, passages of lyrical beauty, and outbreaks of restrained melodic intensity into a wistful and dramatic whole, arguably their best yet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5226" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Emily-Hall-150x150.jpg" alt="Emily Hall" width="150" height="150" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Emily-Hall-150x150.jpg 150w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Emily-Hall-300x300.jpg 300w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Emily-Hall-768x768.jpg 768w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Emily-Hall-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Emily-Hall.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" />#7. Emily Hall – Folie à Deux</strong><br />
Ostensibly an opera about shared delusion and receiving cosmic messages from an electricity pylon, this charming release sounds more like ambient than opera. Pure, melodic voices meditate dreamily on madness and our relationship to each other and the world that speaks through our electric technologies to the accompaniment of electronic textures, creating a mesmerizing and delightful sound.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5232" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Kangding-Ray-150x150.jpeg" alt="Kangding Ray" width="150" height="150" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Kangding-Ray-150x150.jpeg 150w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Kangding-Ray-300x300.jpeg 300w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Kangding-Ray.jpeg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" />#8. Kangding Ray – Cory Arcane</strong><br />
I expected this year’s blockbuster from the raster-noton label to be Alva Noto’s Xerrox 3 (which I liked, but am still growing to love), but in the short term at least was more impacted by Kangding Ray’s uneasily skittering techno. Intricate rhythms shift and collide, accompanied by a narrative about the decay of consumerist technological society yet carrying a visceral appeal as pure sound.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5222" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Autistici-150x150.jpg" alt="Autistici" width="150" height="150" />#9. Autistici – Temporal Enhancement</strong><br />
Abstract in concept (an exploration of our perception of sound in its relation to time) and in execution (a focus on sounds themselves and their tensions with one another), this album nevertheless also manages to cohere as a compelling and finely wrought listening experience. The second entry on this list from the Dronarivm label, which had a fine year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5224" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Dag-Rosenqvist-150x150.jpg" alt="Dag Rosenqvist" width="150" height="150" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Dag-Rosenqvist-150x150.jpg 150w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Dag-Rosenqvist-300x300.jpg 300w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Dag-Rosenqvist-768x768.jpg 768w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Dag-Rosenqvist-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Dag-Rosenqvist.jpg 1181w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" />#10. Dag Rosenqvist – The Forest Diaries</strong><br />
Rosenqvist had a busy year, but charmed me most with this disarmingly simple set of piano/organ meditations that combine stillness with an undercurrent of dissonance. Notes are allowed to linger and decay, giving time to absorb and reflect. Music for a thoughtful evening.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5241" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Deupree-150x150.jpg" alt="Deupree" width="150" height="150" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Deupree-150x150.jpg 150w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Deupree-300x300.jpg 300w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Deupree.jpg 590w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" />#11. Taylor Deupree and Marcus Fischer – Twine</strong><br />
Another serving of the distinctive kind of microscopic beauty that Deupree’s 12k label has been honing for many years now. Gently hissing tape loops undulate their way softly through time, sparsely dusted with gentle chimes and wobbles, seeping softly into the future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

En’s follow up to the excellent Already Gone uses their distinctive palette to good effect. Passages of calmly undulating drones sit in tension with densely layered flurries of sound that reach for a cascading majesty, all heard through a dreamy, blurring filter. A distinctive world to get lost in. Full review<a href="http://musicisgood.org/2015/12/review-city-of-brides-by-en/"> here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>#13 Seckou Keita &#8211; 22 Strings</strong></p>
<p>This album offers elegant, and life-affirming instrumentals by a master kora-player from Senegal, a few of them accompanied by gentle vocals. African and Western sensibilities interweave in the compositions, and the sound is delicate and warmly inviting.</p>

<p><strong>#14 Goldmund &#8211; Sometimes</strong></p>
<p>Another entry in the atmospheric piano miniatures genre, this deeply melodic and contemplative album combines the gentle piano gestures with light electronic washes to create a beautiful sonic landscape that invites introspection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5235" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Port-st-willow-150x150.jpg" alt="Port st willow" width="150" height="150" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Port-st-willow-150x150.jpg 150w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Port-st-willow-300x300.jpg 300w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Port-st-willow.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" />#15. Port St. Willow – Syncope</strong><br />
The instrumentation here is sparse and restrained, the falsetto vocal plaintive. Patient percussion, punctuating flutters of guitar and electronics, and the undulating melodies create an atmosphere that reminds me of late-period, post-pop Talk Talk.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5230" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Ian-William-Craig-150x150.png" alt="Ian William Craig" width="150" height="150" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Ian-William-Craig-150x150.png 150w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Ian-William-Craig-300x300.png 300w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Ian-William-Craig-768x768.png 768w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Ian-William-Craig.png 790w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" />#16. Ian William Craig – Cradle for the Wanting</strong><br />
Ian William Craig has spent several albums doggedly refining an unusual recipe – ambient compositions based on varying kinds of manipulation of his trained tenor voice. Cradle for the Wanting is perhaps the purest installment yet, the haunting, wordless vocals dancing with their own sonic decay.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5223" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Chris-Bissonnette-150x150.jpg" alt="Chris Bissonnette" width="150" height="150" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Chris-Bissonnette-150x150.jpg 150w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Chris-Bissonnette-300x300.jpg 300w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Chris-Bissonnette.jpg 745w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" />#17. Christopher Bissonnette &#8211; Pitch, Paper &amp; Foil</strong><br />
Very much in continuity with last year’s Essays in Idleness, this album continues Bissonnette’s move away from his earlier ambient palette and into his engagement with quavering synth soliloquies. I am left feeling as if it is less a matter of playing music on the synth and more of coaxing the synth into speech, drawing forth a fragile voice from it that sings in its own expressive tongue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5231" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Irisarri-150x150.jpg" alt="Irisarri" width="150" height="150" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Irisarri-150x150.jpg 150w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Irisarri.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" />#18. Rafael Anton Irisarri &#8211; A Fragile Geography</strong><br />
Irisarri’s work is consistently worth listening to, and here as always he achieves a depth of texture and grandness of gesture that lend tremendous weight and presence to his dronescapes. Another important release to add to his growing oeuvre.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Alva Noto &#8211; Xerrox Vol 3</strong><br />
Xerrox Vol 2 is an album that I admire greatly, and there was a 6-year wait for its successor; I think my ears were therefore too primed for something similar. Xerrox 3 is more sparse and subdued and yet also more overtly emotive. Like all of Carsten Nicolai’s work it exudes precision and care. I suspect it will continue to grow on me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5239" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Vivaldi-150x150.jpg" alt="Vivaldi" width="150" height="150" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Vivaldi-150x150.jpg 150w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Vivaldi-300x300.jpg 300w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Vivaldi.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" />#20. Fabio Biondi &#8211; Vivaldi: I concerti dell&#8217;addio</strong><br />
I ended up listening to a lot of Vivaldi this year after learning that his music didn’t have to be played like the Vivaldi I grew up hearing. Fabio Biondi’s versions of Vivaldi are always vibrant, and this new collection has rich texture and the accustomed verve.</p>

<p>En&#8217;s last album, <em>Already Gone</em>, (<a href="http://musicisgood.org/2012/04/review-already-gone-by-en/" target="_blank">review here</a>) was notable both for its distinctive palette of sounds and for its cohesion. It offered a succession of tracks of increasing length, culminating and resolving in a 20-minute meditation on <em>Elysium</em>, the mythical Greek isle of the blessed. <a href="http://studentsofdecay.com/post/132222852294/en-city-of-brides" target="_blank"><em>City of Brides</em> </a>(the title of the new double LP and of its closing track &#8211; another eschatological tinge, I wonder?) is less linear. Indeed it thrives on a restless exploration of shifting and contrasting sounds, skipping from noise to clarity, from stasis to rippling motion, from soft to abrasive as we wander from moment to moment and from track to track. And yet there remains a sense of deep unity, as if the various tracks are somehow probing the same question, prodding at the same possibility.<span id="more-5200"></span></p>
<p>The opener, <em>Blades</em>, greets us with a melodic buzz of distorted, metallic tones that gyrate their way into an encroaching bed of noise until they end up circling in a sludgy loop. It seems a rather abrasive beginning, especially to ears that remember <em>Elysium</em>, but somehow makes sense as we hit the sudden contrast with its successor. The abrupt clarity of the resounding clusters of plucked koto notes that begin <em>Dead Ringer</em> is a startling shift, yet those notes too begin to buzz with a growing halo of distortion, until the clear opening notes finally reassert themselves. Listening to this track after <em>Blades</em> is a little like reading a novel in which the scene suddenly shifts to a new location which turns out to be part of the same story. Then <em>Blonde is Back</em> takes us down another path, plunging us into a warmly drifting wash of sound punctuated by subtle bass thrums, dreamy and soft &#8211; and yet embedded in a continuing abrasive buzz that retains a thread of continuity with the preceding tracks. As the buzz recedes, the whole slowly submerges in a gauzy sea of synthetic whispers. We have been led through three contrasting sound worlds, three sonic rooms, apparently held together by the halo of noise through which they emerge.</p>
<p>The same sense of contrast and continuity plays throughout the album. The wittily titled <em>Awkward Paws</em> offers pattering drops of sound echoing in a gentle haze, before a flock of strings flurries past like a sudden patter of rain, leaving behind a clean, peaceful drone, clearly evoking motifs from <em>Already Gone</em>. Just as we ease into rest, a scratchy, percussive abrasion interrupts the reverie and jolts us into the wonderful <em>Mendocino Nature Rave</em>. The earthy creaking anchors a more spacey realm of quavering, whooshing, synthetic sounds. The swoops and oscillations gather in increasing density, creating a deliciously rich, twittering crescendo that marries depth and majesty with eddying motion before fading into a spray of echoing pulses. This pair of tracks highlights a recurring duality in En’s music, which offers contrasting paths to bliss: a restful calm evoked by warmly and sedately swaying tones, or an accumulation of so many simultaneously scurrying, circling flurries of sound that a kind of deep grandeur emerges, like all the creatures of the world glimpsed at once in motion. (<em>Secret Samba</em> offers another very effective instance of this latter effect.)</p>
<p>Two of the tracks form a dyad. <em>Songs for Diminished Lovemaking Part 1</em> initially calms the proceedings with a steady, soft drone before bright sweeps of reedy sound rise from it and swirl restlessly, questing upward over a slight, gentle rhythm until the track quietly draws to a close. A few tracks later, <em>Part 2</em> opens morosely with a subdued hum, deep gurgles, and a forlorn scrape of strings straining to attain forward motion. The effort is repeated with gradually increasing force and breadth of sound until a grander resonance is attained, like an orchestra tuning while trying to rise from a bubbling swamp. Further adding to the loose sense of architecture, the scratchy rhythms, bubbling synthetic sounds, and gritty crackles of album closer <em>City of Brides</em> create a blend of melody and noise that recalls the opening track.</p>
<p>En&#8217;s music is not about well-defined shapes and clear edges. Patterns overlap, swirl in moiré motion, and dissolve, warm drones wobble and sway at a languid distance, and clear, sharp notes emerge only as fleeting moments of orientation. Pervading both <em>Already Gone</em> and <em>City of Brides</em> is a nostalgic evocation of a blurry transcendence, a gesture toward a world of fluttering beauty and healing calm heard through the mist of dreams, through the indistinct sway of a warm ocean, or through a grainy filter of imperfection. En&#8217;s music evokes without clearly naming, painting in sound a world not quite graspable but beautiful nonetheless. It leaves a lasting impression and amply rewards repeated listening.

<p>I didn&#8217;t plan to write a review tonight. But the CD was playing and it caught me up and carried me away and I had to write&#8230;</p>
<p>Wil Bolton&#8217;s music is part of the texture of my world. I always enjoy his releases to one degree or another, but a handful of them have risen from &#8220;this is nice&#8221; to &#8220;this is one of my favorite things&#8221;. The expressive chimes of <a href="https://wilbolton.bandcamp.com/album/time-lapse" target="_blank"><em>Time Lapse</em></a> and <a href="https://wilbolton.bandcamp.com/album/chimes-for-a-wall-drawing" target="_blank"><em>Chimes for a Wall Drawing</em></a> call forth wonder and remain in my listening rotation years after their release.<span id="more-5185"></span> <a href="https://soundcloud.com/distant-noise-records/wil-tarl-angel-in-the-house" target="_blank">Angel in the House</a>, by Wil &amp; Tarl, is a marvelous drone piece. The last several releases I have enjoyed, but they did not quite creep up onto my inner list of most-favored recordings. And then <a href="https://wilbolton.bandcamp.com/album/inscriptions" target="_blank">Inscriptions</a> came along on Moscow&#8217;s consistently excellent <a href="https://dronarivm.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank">Dronarivm</a> label and charmed me completely.</p>
<p>At the outset, little, softly darting sounds and questing essays on guitar strings draw us into a lush bed of sound, a title track astir with possibility, caressing the air with a gentle, exploratory touch. A deep, rich drone forms an enveloping bed and the guitar notes, rather than playing over or in front of it, seem increasingly to emerge from it and sigh back into its velvety texture. A tight flurry of pulses recurs from time to time, restating an inchoate question. We could rest here for a long time, quite still and in perpetual motion. <em>Hedera</em>, track 2, is for me perhaps the high point of a consistently strong album. A warm droning loop sways sedately, its constant round-and-round-and-up-and-down motion as mesmerizing and soothing as the gentle sway of a kelp forest in a tropical sea. The guitar meditates in a loose, questing pattern as bird cries and small, darting buzzes weave intricately around the sounds. The overall effect is detailed and fascinating, and as warm and wallowing as a fresh-run bath on a winter evening. That the track sways on for some time without departing from its message is part of its success; I never want it to end.</p>
<p>End it does, but <em>Seed</em> picks up right where it left off. It modulates the tone a little, adds some human sounds of children playing and some creaks and crackles, offers a slightly more purposeful guitar pattern, and sways ever onward. As I listen I am again impressed with how complex the mood is. This music is warm and comforting. It is melancholy and wistful. It is gently affirming of world and life. It is nostalgic and thoughtful. It is questioning and pensive. It is often all of these things at the same time, a restful restlessness that allows the listener to ease back and relax in the swell or become fully engaged in the rich textures.</p>
<p>Track four is called <em>Cathedral</em>. Again everything is the same and everything is different, the guitar more skittish, the drone more plaintive, the space evoked by the field recordings more open and seeking, reaching more than circling. Rather than placing us in the intimate company of fellow creatures (birds, children), this track gives a sense of being in the presence of unseen events, of things moving we know not where. <em>Limestone</em>, the final track, wells up warmly, aswirl with crackling light and hope, and eddies us gently with harp-like flurries to a restful end.</p>
<p>And then comes the repeat button.</p>
<p>To say this is my favorite Wil Bolton album is already to say that I like it better than some of my favorite albums, period. I spent the summer wondering what would be high on of my end-of-year list &#8211; I had heard nice things this year, but nothing that had given me that sense that a magical gift had come my way. This is one of those gifts, and I am still gratefully falling in love with it.</p>
<p>I did not plan to write a review tonight. But the CD was playing and it caught me up and carried me along and I had to write&#8230;and fortunately the music is much better than my writing. Stream it below, buy it at Bandcamp and other online stores, luxuriate in it.</p>

<p>Germany&#8217;s Arovane has been putting out some striking ambient material of late, including the recent <a href="https://arovane.bandcamp.com/album/dwell-tevvel-structure" target="_blank">dwell_tevvel_structure</a> on the UK label <a href="http://www.txtrecordings.co.uk/" target="_blank">…txt recordings</a>. I have no idea what a <em>tevvel</em> is, and neither does Google; it&#8217;s an anagram of velvet and bears a passing resemblance to the Dutch teviel (&#8220;too much&#8221;), but who knows if that is relevant. <em>Dwelling</em>, in the sense of settling down and taking time, and <em>structure</em>, here in the form of careful layers of sound, are both terms that illuminate the music on this album. The album consists of four long sound pieces (ranging from 14 to 20 minutes), each with its own distinct character yet tied together sonically in an arc that suggests four movements of a whole. The first opens with a gently undulating drift and fluttering patters of brightness &#8211; perhaps it&#8217;s the cover art, but I find it hard not to think of sunlight sparkling on waves. <span id="more-5183"></span>The effect is relaxing and peaceful in the way the movement of a thousand leaves in a tree in sudden breeze is peaceful. The second track is more subdued, hushed, and grainy. Textured and smooth layers of sound take turns coming to the fore. After a while we are left with an airy but somber machine hum, until faint celestial tones begin to play at the edge of hearing, and almost imperceptibly the enveloping hum warms in tone until it slides into silence. The third track opens with a steady stream of deliciously layered sound, defying the ear to pick out all the strata &#8211; the tiny pulses, the fricative halo around the gentle rasp, the quiet hum, the resonant space around the sounds. The slightest changes come and go as the track streams onward, one of those quietly demanding pieces where nothing at all is happening until you really listen. The final track recalls the first, taking us back to bright open spaces and rushing flurries of sound, this time a little more buoyant and sharply accented. The whole work focuses on layering sound upon sound and giving the rich textures that cause time to stretch out and slowly unfold their different facets. There is lots to enjoy here for the patient listener.</p>

<p>Hot on the heels of that release comes a collaboration with Porya Hatami that has an entirely different feel. <a href="http://store.eter-lab.net/album/resonance" target="_blank" class="broken_link"><strong>Resonance</strong></a> (each track is named for a consecutive letter in the word) on Columbian <a href="http://store.eter-lab.net/music" target="_blank" class="broken_link">Éter records</a>, is darker, denser, a restlessly chattering conversation of small, dark sounds with some startling twists and turns. The album opens with a metallic glistening and an ominous hum, around which other fragments begin to bustle. Hatami&#8217;s releases have most often had a pastoral and rustic bent, but the world evoked here feels darker, more industrial, digital machines burbling and chiming in a cavernous, deserted factory. Things creak and stretch and tumble with resonant clatter as what sound like piano strings are struck, and strummed. A squelchy rhythm begins, haloed by a faint glow, before opening up into the album&#8217;s first contemplative stretch, a delicious blend of hum and hiss and tone that undulates gently for a while before sliding away into gentleness like waves receding. Then the computers are back to their grimly chiming cogitations, evolving into a nighttime jungle of electronic creatures. The electronic backdrop is joined by what sound more like actual bird calls, a dark machine world and nighttime nature merging before mournful strings emerge to add a human note to the scene. Drones layer into a glowing dawn, which abruptly ends in a brief and startling snatch of woozy jazz piano. The pattern of claustrophobically chittering machines, organic rustlings, and more peaceful, expansive tones repeats. As we reach the second N, ResonaNce, the world is brighter, more hopeful, burbling against crackling bright skies of sound. But then things turn ominous again, busy creaks and rustles return, like a wooden ship shifting darkly at its midnight mooring. The temperature drops and unseen presences whisper, until the woozy piano puts in a brief reprise, only to be overcome by a densely humming clatter. The whole is quite abstract and a little eerie, though not shapeless &#8211; a recurring strategy is to end busy pieces with brief closing sections that take them in quite different directions. A sense of being surrounded by small, unidentifiable events and uneasy dialogue between sound worlds makes for an album that is far from soothing but quite thought-provoking on close listening.</p>
