				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Can it be a year since the last list? Here goes with my favorite 20 releases of 2017. Your tastes are not mine, you will disagree, but maybe there is something here that you might not have discovered, something of beauty that might bring you joy. At one point I thought this might be a thin year; when I got down to making the list I realized there was no filler at the bottom. Exact placement is fuzzy – there are lots of apples and oranges being compared here. Feel free to move any of these up or down a few places in your head.</p>
<p><a href="https://12kmusic.bandcamp.com/album/somi"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5412" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/top-20-of-2017-david-smith/Somi-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="200" srcset="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/top-20-of-2017-david-smith/Somi-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/top-20-of-2017-david-smith/Somi-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/top-20-of-2017-david-smith/Somi.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" /></a><strong>#1. Taylor Deupree – Somi</strong></p>
<p>Deupree’s <em>Faint</em> from a few years ago is still one of my regular listens and pleasures, and I wonder with hindsight if I should have placed it at number one that year. He gave me another chance with the magnificent, meditative <em>Somi</em>. Loops of single notes from acoustic instruments played at varying intervals are layered and treated to create a fascinating slow dance of beauty and rest. And the deluxe edition packaging was as gorgeous as the music. (<a href="https://12kmusic.bandcamp.com/album/somi">Listen</a>)</p>

<p><strong>#2. Daniel Herskedal – The Roc</strong></p>
<p>Norwegian tubaist Herskedal’s new album adds an Arabic influence to his tuba-based jazz-folk explorations. The result is a unique, at times magical set of tunes high in atmosphere and richly colored. Several parts of this album stayed in my head all year. (<a href="https://danielherskedal.bandcamp.com/album/the-roc">Listen</a>)</p>

<p><strong>#3. Pausal – Avifaunal</strong></p>
<p>Pausal’s warm and finely textured drones have been growing on me the last few years. This year’s release took things up a notch, with a sweeping grandeur and narrative flow that make each minute count. An album to get lost in. (<a href="https://dronarivm.bandcamp.com/album/avifaunal">Listen</a>)</p>

<p><a href="http://anzicstore.com/album/happy-song"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5417" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/top-20-of-2017-david-smith/Anat-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a></p>
<p><strong>#4. Anat Cohen Tentet – Happy Song</strong></p>
<p>The title and bright yellow cover are apt. New York-based Israeli clarinetist Cohen and her ensemble deliver a vibrantly grooving set of jazz romps that shift in character as the album progresses while maintaining an infectious sense of joy. (<a href="http://anzicstore.com/album/happy-song">Listen</a>)</p>

<p><strong>#5. Tinariwen – Elwan</strong></p>
<p>The Saharan blues return with the latest from the great Tuareg band, and it’s one of their finest. The sinuous, swaying rhythms undergird starkly poetic laments at the loss of social and environmental fabric.

<p><strong>#6. Seldom Sene Recorder Consort – Goldberg Variations</strong></p>
<p>As the title gives away, this is the Goldberg Variations played on recorders by a Dutch recorder consort. In addition to the virtuoso playing, the different sonorities of the wind instruments made the Goldbergs sparkle for me in a gentle and delightful new way. (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJQAgA44gCM">Listen</a>) (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdpwCWBuXpI">Listen</a>)</p>

<p><strong>#7. Otto A. Totland – The Lost</strong></p>
<p>Very similar in spirit to its predecessor, <em>Pinô</em>, this second album of piano solos again showcases Norwegian pianist Otto Totland’s ability to conjure a gentle, plaintive warmth through small melodies and soft sounds. (<a href="https://ottoatotland.bandcamp.com/">Listen</a>)</p>

<p><strong>#8. Chihei Hatakeyama &amp; Federico Durand – Sora</strong></p>
<p>Combining Hatakeyama’s characteristic gossamer tonal washes and Durand’s delightfully pattering small sounds is a recipe for enormous prettiness, and that is just what we get on this deeply calming album. (<a href="https://chiheihatakeyama.bandcamp.com/album/sora">Listen</a>)</p>

<p><strong>#9. The Green Kingdom – The North Wind and the Sun</strong></p>
<p>The Green Kingdom has issued a long series of recordings offering an attractive world of delicate small sounds and textures. This release feels like something fresh as it bursts forth into uplifting melody thanks to the foregrounded guitar work. (<a href="https://thegreenkingdom.bandcamp.com/album/the-north-wind-and-the-sun">Listen/Watch</a>)</p>

<p><strong>#10. Emile Parisien, Vincent Peirani, Andreas Schaerer &amp; Michael Wollny – Out of Land</strong></p>
<p>An unusual but top-notch European jazz combo consisting of sax, accordion, piano, and vocalizations/beatboxing. The live recordings prickle with energy and abound in creativity, making for an exciting listen. (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAKio4qfeqM">Watch</a>)</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://homeassemblymusic.bandcamp.com/album/weve-all-been-swimming"><img class="alignleft wp-image-5421 size-thumbnail" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/top-20-of-2017-david-smith/Fieldhead-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/top-20-of-2017-david-smith/Fieldhead-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/top-20-of-2017-david-smith/Fieldhead-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/top-20-of-2017-david-smith/Fieldhead-768x768.jpg 768w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/top-20-of-2017-david-smith/Fieldhead-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/top-20-of-2017-david-smith/Fieldhead.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a></strong></p>
<p><strong>#11. Fieldhead – We’ve All Been Swimming</strong></p>
<p>Fieldhead’s latest is by far my favorite by the artist so far. It plays with odd rhythmic combinations, layering looping synth melodies over divergent rhythms. The result is a kind of mellow fascination, and great fun. (<a href="https://homeassemblymusic.bandcamp.com/album/weve-all-been-swimming">Listen</a>)</p>

<p><strong>#12. Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark – The Punishment of Luxury</strong></p>
<p>Not much pop makes my lists, but I loved OMD as a teen, and this new release sounds as if it could have been the immediate follow up to 1983’s <em>Dazzle Ships</em>. It nails what made their original Kraftwerk-with-soul sound special, and that made me grin. (<a href="https://officialomd.bandcamp.com/releases">Listen</a>)</p>

<p><strong>#13. Rudresh Mahanthappa/Indo-Pak Coalition – Agrima </strong></p>

<p><strong>#14. Helge Lien Trio – Guzuguzu</strong></p>
<p>With track titles drawn from Japanese onomatopoeia, Helge Lien’s latest piano trio album is made up of moody evocations of atmosphere and movement, often skirting around song structures.

<p><strong>#15. Porya Hatami – Monads</strong></p>
<p>When I posted my review of this to Facebook none of my friends hit “like,” and it is admittedly a pretty abstract set of experiments with sound rather than a collection of tunes. But they are fascinating experiments, glimpses into the push-and-pull of forces that make the world a place with sound.

<p>Ahmed is a British-Bahraini trumpeter who here successfully melds Arabic motifs, electronic treatments, and jazz trumpet in a set of beguiling tunes. (<a href="https://yazzahmed.bandcamp.com/album/la-saboteuse-2">Listen</a>)</p>

<p><strong>#17. Alea Saxophone Quartet – Arvo Pärt: Anima</strong></p>
<p>If the idea of Pärt played on saxophones conjures up a mental collision of ethereal voices and ill-chosen skronking, think again. The pure tones and harmonies of the sax quartet evocatively capture the spirit of Pärt’s austere choral pieces.

<p><strong>#18. Taylor Deupree &amp; Marcus Fischer – Lowlands</strong></p>
<p>Building on previous outings as a duo, Deupree and Fischer again show a mastery of the microscopic world of small resonances, adding another delightful release to their growing oeuvre. (<a href="https://12kmusic.bandcamp.com/album/lowlands">Listen</a>)</p>

<p><strong>#19. Brot &amp; Sterne – Tales of Herbst</strong></p>
<p>This was not quite like anything else I listened to, which is perhaps not surprising in the case of a hurdy-gurdy/hang drum/trumpet jazz trio. The improvised instrumentals set warmly tuneful passages amid unique and atmospheric textures. (<a href="https://brotundsterne.bandcamp.com/releases">Listen</a>)</p>

<p><strong>#20. Billow Observatory – II: Plains/Patterns </strong></p>
<p>More active than their debut release, this collection of ambient pieces pulses and shimmers airily. Enjoyable throughout. (<a href="https://billowobservatory.bandcamp.com/album/ii-plains-patterns">Listen</a>)</p>

<p><strong>The next 10&#8230;</strong></p>
<p>And here are ten more that I had a really hard time cutting to get the list down to 20. Some of these jumped in and out of my list several times, and might have made it if I had finalized the list tomorrow. Alphabetically:</p>
<p>Wil Bolton – Night Paths (Ambient)</p>
<p>Bruce Cockburn – Bone on Bone (Folk)</p>
<p>Marcus Fischer – Loss (Ambient)</p>
<p>From the Mouth of the Sun – Hymn Binding (Modern Classical)</p>
<p>Ian Hawgood &amp; Wil Bolton – Transparencies (Ambient)</p>
<p>Hudson – Hudson (Jazz)</p>
<p>Rafael Anton Irisarri – The Shameless Years (Ambient)</p>
<p>Benedikt Jahnel Trio – The Invariant (Piano jazz)</p>
<p>Darren McClure – Nature Mirror (Ambient)</p>
<p>Phronesis, Julian Argüelles, &amp; Frankfurt Radio Big Band – The Behemoth (Jazz)</p>
<p>As ever, if any of the artists happen by, thank you for another year of inspiring music.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This has been another excellent year in classical recordings for me. I remain amazed at how much fine music of the past there is for me to discover, not to mention the brand-new delights that are increasingly catching my ear. This process of exploration means that, as usual, my list tends to avoid the standard classical repertoire but nevertheless covers plenty of ground.<span id="more-5279"></span></p>

<strong> David Lang: The Difficulty of Crossing a Field</strong><br />
<em> Beverly O&#8217;Regan Thiele; Jay O. Sanders; Harlem String Quartet; Douglas Kinney Frost</em><br />
<em> [Cantaloupe]</em></p>
<p>David Lang&#8217;s signature dark beauties are on full display in this 2002 opera. Ambrose Bierce&#8217;s short-short story is essentially a piece of reportage describing the unexplained disappearance of an Alabama plantation owner as he walked across a pasture; Mac Wellman&#8217;s libretto ingeniously expands on the tale, still providing no answers but adding great depth and humanity.</p>

<strong> Field Recordings</strong><br />
<em>Bang On A Can All-Stars</em><br />
<em> [Cantaloupe]</em></p>
<p>Twelve new pieces (plus an extract from Steve Reich&#8217;s <em>The Cave</em>) in which the composer makes use of a piece of previously recorded material: from John Cage speaking (Florent Ghys) to Chicago street musicians (Anna Clyne) to blades being sharpened (David Lang). Despite the varied nature of the fare on offer, it all comes together wonderfully to make a proper album.</p>

<strong> Render</strong><br />
<em>Roomful of Teeth</em><br />
<em> [New Amsterdam]</em></p>
<p>Back in the height of the avant-garde, people like Berio, Ligeti and Stockhausen were writing weird pieces that explored the possibilities of what could be done with the human voice. If, like me, you admired the cleverness and occasional wit of it all but wished they could, you know, write a good tune, then this compelling new music in thrilling performances is just what you need.</p>

<strong> Nikolai Peyko: Piano music, volume 2</strong><br />
<em>Dmitry Korostelyov</em><br />
<em> [Toccata]</em></p>
<p>Nikolay Peyko (1916-1995) was an important figure in Russian musical life, though I&#8217;d not heard of him before this album. The music here ranges from 1942 to 1992 and is what you might expect (indeed, hope for) from someone who was once Shostakovich&#8217;s teaching assistant. Unfortunately little of Peyko&#8217;s music is available in recordings, but he might deserve a Weinberg-style revival.</p>

<strong> Lauren Karpman: Ask Your Mama</strong><br />
<em>various; San Francisco Ballet Orchestra/George Manahan</em><br />
<em> [Avie]</em></p>
<p>When Langston Hughes published his epic <em>Ask Your Mama: 12 Moods for Jazz</em> in 1961, he included in the margins instructions for musical accompaniment. In her equally epic setting that fuses jazz, hip-hop and classical with a bit of sound collage thrown in, Lauren Karpman follows his lead – though sometimes more as guideline than as gospel – to inspired effect.</p>

<strong> If the Owl Calls Again</strong><br />
<em>Christianne Stotijn</em><br />
<em> [Warner]</em></p>
<p>One of my favourite mezzos here presents a recital inspired by her fascination with owls as a source of wisdom and what she calls “philosophical recognition of nature”. It&#8217;s a diverse set of music – from Mussorgsky through Bridge and Ravel to the present-day, with texts in seven languages – but Stotijn&#8217;s committed performances bind it all into a coherent whole.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<strong> JS Bach: Goldberg Variations (arr Sitkovetsky)</strong><br />
<em>Britten Sinfonia/Thomas Gould</em><br />
<em> [Harmonia Mundi]</em></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve remarked before that Bach&#8217;s music lends itself to arrangement for pretty much any instrument, and here we are again&#8230; Dmitri Sitkovetsky created a string trio version in 1985, then expanded it for string orchestra as heard here. The timbre has a lovely warm glow – none of the clotted excesses of the “big band” Bach of yore.</p>

<strong> Haydn &amp; Mozart: Concertos</strong><br />
<em>Arcangelo/Jonathan Cohen</em><br />
<em> [Hyperion]</em></p>
<p>Speaking of “big band” music, when this release came out I realised that my only recordings of Mozart&#8217;s oboe and bassoon concertos were the 40-year-old ones from Karl Böhm and the Vienna Philharmonic. We live in a different world now! Arcangelo has become a real go-to group for 18th-century music – this year&#8217;s recording of Mozart violin concertos with Vilde Frang is also a keeper.</p>

<p>As might be anticipated from its affirmative title, this French soprano&#8217;s collection of arias and songs from the early 20th century is a mostly cheerful affair. There are some old favourites – Lehár&#8217;s <em>Vilja-Lied</em>, Weill&#8217;s <em>Morität von Mackie Messer</em>, and Youmans&#8217;s <em>Tea for two</em> (all <em>en Français</em>) – but plenty of charming discoveries from the likes of Messager, Hahn, and Honegger.</p>

<strong> Lois V Vierk: Words Fail Me</strong><br />
<em>various</em><br />
<em> [New World]</em></p>
<p>A notable figure in the downtown New York scene of the 80s and 90s, Vierk hasn&#8217;t composed much since then because of a long-term illness. Her music&#8217;s minimalist, but greatly influenced by the courtly <em>gagaku</em> music of Japan. Three of the four pieces here are from 1991-6; the title work from 2005 is a response to 9/11, 7 minutes of melancholy followed by 12 of a relentlessly driving climax.</p>

<strong> Julia Wolfe: Anthracite Fields</strong><br />
<em>Trinity Wall Street Choir; Bang On A Can All-Stars</em><br />
<em> [Cantaloupe]</em></p>
<p>The Pulitzer Prize for Music has been on a roll lately, the last three winners being Caroline Shaw, John Luther Adams, and now – hurrah! &#8211; Julia Wolfe. <em>Anthracite Fields</em> is an oratorio paying tribute to the coal miners of Pennsylvania and their families; in its mix of folk materials, Glass-like minimalism and much else besides, it builds on Wolfe&#8217;s achievements in <em>Steel Hammer</em>.</p>

<strong> Philip Glass: Complete Etudes</strong><br />
<em>Nicolas Horvath</em><br />
<em> [Grand Piano]</em></p>
<p>2015 was the year Philip Glass became one of my favourite composers again. I first fell in love with his late-70s/early-80s works (such as the “trilogy operas”) but wasn&#8217;t so impressed with his subsequent work. More recently, though, he seems to have found new focus (or perhaps it&#8217;s just me), and the two sets of etudes from 1995 and 2012 add a dash of romanticism to his familiar style.</p>

<strong> Postcard from Heaven</strong><br />
<em>Susan Allen</em><br />
<em> [New World]</em></p>
<p>An album of music mostly for solo harp should not under normal circumstances make my end-of-year list. But bookended by two John Cage pieces – <em>In a Landscape</em> and the title work – Susan Allen&#8217;s recital has little hint of the drawing-room about it. Gloria Coates&#8217;s Goethe-inspired <em>Perchance to Dream</em> for harp and vibraphone is the haunting highlight.</p>

<strong> Time Present and Time Past</strong><br />
<em>Mahan Esfahani; Concerto Köln</em><br />
<em> [Deutsche Grammophon]</em></p>
<p>Harpsichordist-of-the-moment Mahan Esfahani&#8217;s major-label debut doesn&#8217;t play it safe. Yes, we&#8217;ve got works from Geminiani, a Scarlatti, and a couple of Bachs, but there&#8217;s also Gorécki&#8217;s 1980 harpsichord concerto and – what? &#8211; an arrangement of Steve Reich&#8217;s <em>Piano Phase</em>. An ingenious addition that works so well it elevates the rest of the album onto this list.</p>

<strong> Concert Celeste</strong><br />
<em>Ensemble Obsidienne/Emmanuel Bonnardot</em><br />
<em> [Eloquentia]</em></p>
<p>Ensemble Obsidienne have been artists in residence at Sens cathedral, France, for several years, and they take the 850th anniversary of the cathedral&#8217;s construction as the inspiration for this “musical adventure” . The program&#8217;s centered around four specific feasts of the church year, but it covers enough ground, geographically and chronologically, to function as a handy introduction to medieval music generally.</p>

<strong> Olivier Messiaen: L&#8217;Amour et la Foi</strong><br />
<em>Danish National Vocal Ensemble &amp; Chamber Choir/Marcus Creed</em><br />
<em> [OUR]</em></p>
<p>I wouldn&#8217;t usually expect Messiaen to show up on one of these lists either, because I&#8217;ve never really warmed to his particular brand of mystic modernism. But sometimes you take a chance and it works out splendidly, and such is this case here. Perhaps it&#8217;s that the three works here are early ones; anyway, I was hooked by the varied colours and occasional weirdnesses on display.</p>

<strong> The Tempest</strong><br />
<em>La Tempête/Simon-Pierre Bestion</em><br />
<em> [Alpha]</em><br />
The songs in Shakespeare&#8217;s “The Tempest” have been set many times, and here the appropriately named La Tempête places Frank Martin&#8217;s a cappella <em>Songs of Ariel</em> in among the incidental music composed by Matthew Locke and others for a 1674 production of the play, along with some other unconnected old and new works. The contrasting styles work surprisingly well together.</p>

<strong> John Adams: Absolute Jest; Grand Pianola Music</strong><br />
<em>St. Lawrence String Quartet; San Francisco Symphony/Michael Tilson Thomas</em><br />
<em> [SFS Media]</em></p>
<p>John Adams called the creation of <em>Absolute Jest</em>, for the odd combination of string quartet and orchestra, a “lesson in counterpoint, in thematic transformation and formal design”, which makes it sound a lot less fun that what it is: a joyful play on various Beethoven scherzos. It&#8217;s a worthy companion to the older <em>Grand Pianola Music</em>, which shocked modernists with its use of a big tune in the finale.</p>

<strong> JS Bach: Harpsichord concertos</strong><br />
<em>Andreas Staier; Freiburger Barockorchester</em><br />
<em> [Harmonia Mundi]</em></p>
<p>Bach, Staier, Freiburg&#8230; pretty much a no-brainer really. The orchestra has a lovely rich texture when called for, and Staier&#8217;s harpsichord blends well. I&#8217;m not one to ever talk about benchmark performances, but there&#8217;s no reason why these vivacious ones can&#8217;t be considered as such.</p>

<strong> Vaughan Williams, MacMillan: Oboe concertos</strong><br />
<em>Nicholas Daniel; Britten Sinfonia/James MacMillan</em><br />
<em> [Harmonia Mundi]</em></p>
<p>A welcome outing for Vaughan Williams&#8217;s gorgeous wartime concerto, accompanied by a new one from James MacMillan that should easily enter the repertoire. Nicholas Daniel, for whom the work was written, sparkles in the lively outer movements and consoles in the powerful lamenting middle movement. As a substantial filler we get Britten&#8217;s late folk suite <em>A Time There Was</em>.</p>

<strong> Michael Gordon: Dystopia; Rewriting Beethoven&#8217;s Seventh Symphony</strong><br />
<em>Los Angeles Philharmonic/David Robertson; Bamberg Symphony/Jonathan Nott</em><br />
<em> [Cantaloupe]</em></p>
<p>I guess <em>Dystopia</em> in all its brash chaos is intended as the main attraction here – and it&#8217;s quite a workout for the orchestra – but its shorter companion is the one that most caught my ear. <em>Rewriting Beethoven&#8217;s Seventh Symphony</em> does exactly that: brief segments of each movement of that iconic work are subjected to various shenanigans to create something truly spellbinding.</p>

<strong> Bryce Dessner: Music for Wood and Strings</strong><br />
<em>So Percussion</em><br />
<em> [Brassland]</em></p>
<p>When I heard this work for specially built dulcimer-like instruments in concert back in March, I said “It’s a bitty sort of piece but falls easy on the ear.” I suspected it would grow on me with further listens, and the recording that soon followed has confirmed its pleasures. Without the benefit of seeing the performers, it&#8217;s even harder to believe that they&#8217;re percussionists.</p>

<strong> Arvo Pärt: Tintinnabuli</strong><br />
<em>Tallis Scholars/Peter Phillips</em><br />
<em> [Gimell]</em></p>
<p>It&#8217;s rare that the Tallis Scholars go near post-Renaissance music, but Pärt and his use of diatonic melody makes an obvious fit. The choir also stick to their usual style, with two voices to a part, which reinforces the connection. The results are as fine as you might want, even if you bought the album thinking it had something to do with a certain boy reporter and his dog.</p>

<strong> Philip Glass: Partita for solo violin</strong><br />
<em>Tim Fain</em><br />
<em> [Orange Mountain Music]</em></p>
<p>If the title alone sounds like a summoning of the ghost of Bach, wait till you hear the music. But my first encounter with Glass – the “Opening” of <em>Glassworks</em> – made me think of Bach, so all these years later I find I&#8217;m not so surprised. A version of “Knee 2” from <em>Einstein on the Beach</em> shows how Glass&#8217;s music both has and hasn&#8217;t changed over the intervening three decades.</p>

<strong> Johan Wagenaar: Sinfonietta &amp; symphonic poems</strong><br />
<em>Nordwestdeutsche Philharmonie/Antony Hermus</em><br />
<em> [CPO]</em></p>
<p>The Dutch composer&#8217;s Sinfonietta was composed in 1917 when he was in his mid-fifties, and it sounds to me for all the world like a very light-hearted Mahler. I know Wagneaar at some point in his life conducted Mahler&#8217;s music, but I have no idea if this piece is a deliberate homage. Either way, it&#8217;s a wonderful surprise. The other works provide more Straussian pleasures.</p>

<strong> 1865 &#8211; Songs of Hope and Home</strong><br />
<em>Anonymous 4; Bruce Molsky</em><br />
<em> [Harmonia Mundi]</em></p>
<p>This is, alas, the final album from the fantastic four. It&#8217;s the third in their series of recordings of American folk music, and here their distinctive vocal blend is accompanied/enhanced by Bruce Molsky&#8217;s fiddle, banjo, guitar and voice. As the title indicates, it&#8217;s Civil War-era music, including several still-popular tunes.</p>

<strong> Johann Hermann Schein: Musica Boscareccia</strong><br />
<em>United Continuo Ensemble/Thor-Harald Johnsen</em><br />
<em> [Pan]</em></p>
<p>In my ongoing explorations, I&#8217;ve yet to get a firm handle on the music of the 17th century (with some obvious exceptions like Monteverdi and Purcell). Schein&#8217;s 1621 collection of secular songs for 1-3 voices, which loosely translates as “Forest Music”, helps fill a gap; he was one of the first German composers to make use of the new Italian style of the early Baroque, and these performances certainly feel fresh.</p>

<strong> Armarium</strong><br />
<em>Amarcord</em><br />
<em> [Raumklang]</em></p>
<p>The vocal sextet Amarcord was founded by former members of the St. Thomas Boys Choir in Leipzig, and this release celebrates the rich heritage of musical manuscripts housed at St. Thomas&#8217;s, an armarium being a book cabinet. Bach was of course the most famous cantor there, but the music here precedes his tenure by a century and more.</p>

<strong> Félicien David: Le Désert</strong><br />
<em>Accentus; Orchestre de Chambre de Paris/Laurence Equilbey</em><br />
<em> [Naive]</em></p>
<p><em>Le Désert</em> was a big success when it first appeared in 1844, counting Berlioz among its fans, but it&#8217;s been mostly forgotten for some time. This “ode-symphonie” depicting a caravan&#8217;s journey helped usher in a fad for Orientalism, though in fairness to David his inspiration came from an actual trip to the Middle East. Maybe not a major (re)discovery, but most entertaining nonetheless.</p>

<strong> Douglas Lilburn: Chamber music for strings</strong><br />
<em>New Zealand String Quartet</em><br />
<em> [Naxos]</em></p>
<p>New Zealand&#8217;s best-known composer, Lilburn would have been 100 in 2015 (he died 14 years ago). Vaughan Williams was his composition tutor when he studied in London, and I think it&#8217;s fair to say that if you enjoy VW you&#8217;ll probably like these pieces from the 1940s and 50s. As an introduction to an unknown composer, this is superb.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here is my top 20 music releases for 2015, with no claim that they are somehow objectively the best or that I listened to everything anyone else did. I have found things that delighted me on other people’s lists, and the point of the exercise is not to replicate or compete with those lists but to highlight some things you may not have found, things that might delight you. The sequence changed every time I made a shortlist, so take the numbers with a pinch of salt – all of them could be at least plus or minus 5 on a given day.<span id="more-5218"></span></p>
<p><img class="alignleft wp-image-5195" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/review-inscriptions-by-wil-bolton/Inscriptions-150x150.jpg" alt="Inscriptions" width="200" height="200" srcset="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/review-inscriptions-by-wil-bolton/Inscriptions-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/review-inscriptions-by-wil-bolton/Inscriptions.jpg 280w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>#1.</strong> <strong>Wil Bolton – Inscriptions</strong><br />
I have loved many of Wil Bolton’s releases, and this one was especially captivating, a cohesive suite of carefully textured ambient soundscapes of great warmth and delicacy. A delight for the ears from start to finish. Full review <a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//2015/12/review-inscriptions-by-wil-bolton/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5234" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Nils-Frahm-150x150.jpg" alt="Nils Frahm" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Nils-Frahm-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Nils-Frahm-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Nils-Frahm.jpg 512w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>#2. Nils Frahm – Solo</strong><br />
Nils Frahm has had a prolific year, including a film score and electronic duets with Ólafur Arnalds, but where he remains unrivaled is as a painter of fragile intimacy on the piano. This collection of solo piano pieces did not disappoint, offering both slow affection and rhythmic drive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5233" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Kari-Ikonen-150x150.jpg" alt="Kari Ikonen" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Kari-Ikonen-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Kari-Ikonen.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>#<strong>3. Kari Ikonen Trio &#8211; Beauteous Tales and Offbeat Stories</strong><br />
From scampering piano romps to meditative arco bass passages, from stately melodies to discordant experimental interludes, this album charms with its variety and adds another thread to my fondness for Scandinavian piano jazz.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5229" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Hatami-mcclure-150x150.jpg" alt="Hatami mcclure" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Hatami-mcclure-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Hatami-mcclure.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" />#4. Porya Hatami and Darren Mcclure – In-Between Spaces</strong><br />
A delicious marriage of McClure’s abstract tones and Hatami’s gently burbling textures, this joint essay in textured ambiance is gently reflective in mood, a continual, fragile, questing movement within a basic rest. Another excellent release for Hatami, and a fine companion to McClure’s excellent Primary Locations from earlier in the year.</p>

Den Sorte Skole – Indians and Cowboys</strong><br />
Den Sorte Skole take thousands of small samples from old vinyl records and weave them into eclectic tapestries in which they become a cohesive, dappled, new whole. An unerring sense of groove is married to sounds and voices from the past and around the world. Get it for free at the artists’ site <a href="http://densorteskole.net/">here</a>.</p>

Esmerine &#8211; Lost Voices</strong><br />
Marimba, percussion and strings are the backbone of Esmerine’s moody miniatures. The music sometimes shares the ponderous majesty of related bands godspeed you! black emperor and Thee Silver Mt. Zion, but its idiom is more acoustic, rooted in marimba, strings and drums. Lost Voices builds gentle rhythms, passages of lyrical beauty, and outbreaks of restrained melodic intensity into a wistful and dramatic whole, arguably their best yet.</p>

Emily Hall – Folie à Deux</strong><br />
Ostensibly an opera about shared delusion and receiving cosmic messages from an electricity pylon, this charming release sounds more like ambient than opera. Pure, melodic voices meditate dreamily on madness and our relationship to each other and the world that speaks through our electric technologies to the accompaniment of electronic textures, creating a mesmerizing and delightful sound.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5232" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Kangding-Ray-150x150.jpeg" alt="Kangding Ray" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Kangding-Ray-150x150.jpeg 150w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Kangding-Ray-300x300.jpeg 300w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Kangding-Ray.jpeg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" />#8. Kangding Ray – Cory Arcane</strong><br />
I expected this year’s blockbuster from the raster-noton label to be Alva Noto’s Xerrox 3 (which I liked, but am still growing to love), but in the short term at least was more impacted by Kangding Ray’s uneasily skittering techno. Intricate rhythms shift and collide, accompanied by a narrative about the decay of consumerist technological society yet carrying a visceral appeal as pure sound.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5222" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Autistici-150x150.jpg" alt="Autistici" width="150" height="150" />#9. Autistici – Temporal Enhancement</strong><br />
Abstract in concept (an exploration of our perception of sound in its relation to time) and in execution (a focus on sounds themselves and their tensions with one another), this album nevertheless also manages to cohere as a compelling and finely wrought listening experience. The second entry on this list from the Dronarivm label, which had a fine year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5224" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Dag-Rosenqvist-150x150.jpg" alt="Dag Rosenqvist" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Dag-Rosenqvist-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Dag-Rosenqvist-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Dag-Rosenqvist-768x768.jpg 768w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Dag-Rosenqvist-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Dag-Rosenqvist.jpg 1181w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" />#10. Dag Rosenqvist – The Forest Diaries</strong><br />
Rosenqvist had a busy year, but charmed me most with this disarmingly simple set of piano/organ meditations that combine stillness with an undercurrent of dissonance. Notes are allowed to linger and decay, giving time to absorb and reflect. Music for a thoughtful evening.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5241" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Deupree-150x150.jpg" alt="Deupree" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Deupree-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Deupree-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Deupree.jpg 590w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" />#11. Taylor Deupree and Marcus Fischer – Twine</strong><br />
Another serving of the distinctive kind of microscopic beauty that Deupree’s 12k label has been honing for many years now. Gently hissing tape loops undulate their way softly through time, sparsely dusted with gentle chimes and wobbles, seeping softly into the future.</p>

<p><strong>#12. En – City of Brides</strong><br />
En’s follow up to the excellent Already Gone uses their distinctive palette to good effect. Passages of calmly undulating drones sit in tension with densely layered flurries of sound that reach for a cascading majesty, all heard through a dreamy, blurring filter. A distinctive world to get lost in. Full review<a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//2015/12/review-city-of-brides-by-en/"> here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>#13 Seckou Keita &#8211; 22 Strings</strong></p>
<p>This album offers elegant, and life-affirming instrumentals by a master kora-player from Senegal, a few of them accompanied by gentle vocals. African and Western sensibilities interweave in the compositions, and the sound is delicate and warmly inviting.</p>

<p><strong>#14 Goldmund &#8211; Sometimes</strong></p>
<p>Another entry in the atmospheric piano miniatures genre, this deeply melodic and contemplative album combines the gentle piano gestures with light electronic washes to create a beautiful sonic landscape that invites introspection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5235" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Port-st-willow-150x150.jpg" alt="Port st willow" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Port-st-willow-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Port-st-willow-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Port-st-willow.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" />#15. Port St. Willow – Syncope</strong><br />
The instrumentation here is sparse and restrained, the falsetto vocal plaintive. Patient percussion, punctuating flutters of guitar and electronics, and the undulating melodies create an atmosphere that reminds me of late-period, post-pop Talk Talk.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Ian William Craig – Cradle for the Wanting</strong><br />
Ian William Craig has spent several albums doggedly refining an unusual recipe – ambient compositions based on varying kinds of manipulation of his trained tenor voice. Cradle for the Wanting is perhaps the purest installment yet, the haunting, wordless vocals dancing with their own sonic decay.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5223" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Chris-Bissonnette-150x150.jpg" alt="Chris Bissonnette" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Chris-Bissonnette-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Chris-Bissonnette-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Chris-Bissonnette.jpg 745w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" />#17. Christopher Bissonnette &#8211; Pitch, Paper &amp; Foil</strong><br />
Very much in continuity with last year’s Essays in Idleness, this album continues Bissonnette’s move away from his earlier ambient palette and into his engagement with quavering synth soliloquies. I am left feeling as if it is less a matter of playing music on the synth and more of coaxing the synth into speech, drawing forth a fragile voice from it that sings in its own expressive tongue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5231" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Irisarri-150x150.jpg" alt="Irisarri" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Irisarri-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Irisarri.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" />#18. Rafael Anton Irisarri &#8211; A Fragile Geography</strong><br />
Irisarri’s work is consistently worth listening to, and here as always he achieves a depth of texture and grandness of gesture that lend tremendous weight and presence to his dronescapes. Another important release to add to his growing oeuvre.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Alva Noto &#8211; Xerrox Vol 3</strong><br />
Xerrox Vol 2 is an album that I admire greatly, and there was a 6-year wait for its successor; I think my ears were therefore too primed for something similar. Xerrox 3 is more sparse and subdued and yet also more overtly emotive. Like all of Carsten Nicolai’s work it exudes precision and care. I suspect it will continue to grow on me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Fabio Biondi &#8211; Vivaldi: I concerti dell&#8217;addio</strong><br />
I ended up listening to a lot of Vivaldi this year after learning that his music didn’t have to be played like the Vivaldi I grew up hearing. Fabio Biondi’s versions of Vivaldi are always vibrant, and this new collection has rich texture and the accustomed verve.</p>

<p class="western">“What?&#8230; Wow” was, in festival curator David Lang&#8217;s program note, “made by putting together some of the children and grandchildren and maybe by now even great-grandchildren of composers who happen to live down the street from me, and who changed the world.” So he brought along his Bang on a Can friends Julia Wolfe and Michael Gordon, and the Bang on a Can All-Stars, and So Percussion, and for good measure WNYC Radio&#8217;s John Schaefer, and they met up with a whole bunch of Irish musicians in Dublin&#8217;s National Concert Hall, and the result was&#8230; well, here&#8217;s David Lang again, in an <a href="http://www.irishtimes.com/culture/music/david-lang-minimalism-existed-for-about-a-minute-1.2120463">interview</a> with the <i>Irish Times</i> last week: “I’m going to feel disappointed if somebody comes to this concert and likes everything”.</p>
<p>Hmm. There were 19 pieces of music performed over the two days; I heard all but one, and I really hate to disappoint Mr. Lang but&#8230; Maybe if I&#8217;d been able to get to the first performance, Tom Johnson&#8217;s minimalist classic <i>Nine Bells</i> done by percussionist Olaf Pyras, I might not have liked it, but what are the chances?</p>
<div id="attachment_4930" style="width: 250px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/what-wow-david-langs-festival-of-music-in-dublin/wolfe-e1425840157778.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4930" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/what-wow-david-langs-festival-of-music-in-dublin/wolfe-e1425840157778-292x300.jpg" alt="Julia Wolfe" width="240" height="247" srcset="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/what-wow-david-langs-festival-of-music-in-dublin/wolfe-e1425840157778-292x300.jpg 292w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/what-wow-david-langs-festival-of-music-in-dublin/wolfe-e1425840157778-996x1024.jpg 996w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/what-wow-david-langs-festival-of-music-in-dublin/wolfe-e1425840157778.jpg 1225w" sizes="(max-width: 240px) 100vw, 240px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Times,'Times New Roman',serif;">Julia Wolfe</span></span></p></div>
<p class="western">So the festival for me kicked off with my initial reason for going, Julia Wolfe&#8217;s incredible “art-ballad” <i>Steel Hammer,</i>performed, as on the album, by Trio Medieval and the Bang on a Can All-Stars. Seeing it live made me realise I&#8217;d not given much thought to how some of the sounds on the album were produced: that sound evoking a piston engine coming to life? That&#8217;s the band rubbing sheets of sandpaper together. That foot-tapping noise throughout the whole “Characteristics” section? That&#8217;s guitarist Mark Stewart&#8217;s <i>actual feet.</i> And so forth. It was a magnificent performance of a brilliant piece, by superb musicians&#8230; Lord, Lord. I was pleased to be able to thank Julia Wolfe in person. All this went on at the hall&#8217;s Engineering Library (the building was once owned by a university), which I&#8217;d never been in before and which I assumed would be an elegant Victorian room, its walls still lined with ceiling-height bookshelves, a few tall windows allowing the setting sun to cast a warm glow&#8230; well, it did have walls, I&#8217;ll grant you that. The NCH really needs to construct better performance spaces. Or at least get some lads in with a few tins of paint.</p>
<p class="western">Anyway. The <i>other</i> main reason I was there was the European premiere of John Luther Adams&#8217;s big and beautiful orchestral piece <i>Become Ocean,</i> a work that seems to have a better chance than most of making its way into the repertoire. In the main auditorium, the RTÉ National Symphony Orchestra was led by young (23!) English conductor Jamie Phillips, who showed a fine command of proceedings. It&#8217;s a paradoxical piece in a way, because it&#8217;s very carefully structured and symmetrical, yet it relies for its effect on seeming random, like the waves of the ocean. If you had a stopwatch you could easily track the various large and small climaxes, but it&#8217;s so much better to sit back and let these gorgeous swells wash over you. I could have listened all night.</p>
<p class="western">In the interest of brevity, let&#8217;s quickly mention the three other works in that concert: David Lang&#8217;s <i>man made</i> (with So Percussion; satisfying)<i>,</i> Irene Buckley&#8217;s <i>Stórr</i> (inspired by Hebridean church singing; lovely), and Anna Clyne&#8217;s <i>&lt;&lt;Rewind&lt;&lt;</i> (evoking a videotape skipping backwards; amusing).</p>
<div id="attachment_4927" style="width: 250px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/what-wow-david-langs-festival-of-music-in-dublin/gordon-e1425840232233.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4927" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/what-wow-david-langs-festival-of-music-in-dublin/gordon-e1425840232233-282x300.jpg" alt="Michael Gordon" width="240" height="255" srcset="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/what-wow-david-langs-festival-of-music-in-dublin/gordon-e1425840232233-282x300.jpg 282w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/what-wow-david-langs-festival-of-music-in-dublin/gordon-e1425840232233-962x1024.jpg 962w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/what-wow-david-langs-festival-of-music-in-dublin/gordon-e1425840232233.jpg 1240w" sizes="(max-width: 240px) 100vw, 240px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Times,'Times New Roman',serif;">Michael Gordon</span></span></p></div>
<p class="western">But I must talk properly about Michael Gordon&#8217;s new piece, which was so new that it was listed on the festival program as “new work” and we were only told its title when the composer spoke just before the Dublin Guitar Quartet gave its premiere. <i>Amplified</i> is what it is, by name and nature. If you&#8217;ve heard last year&#8217;s release of Gordon&#8217;s bassoon piece <i>Rushes</i> then let me simply describe the general feel of it as “like <i>Rushes</i> but with four amplified guitars”. I admit he had to win me over on this one. It was 10.30, the close of a busy day, there was still an hour-long midnight bus journey ahead, and after about a minute of rather harsh-sounding pulses of loud reverb, each player picking out single notes, I feared an hour of noisy tedium. But I closed my eyes and something wonderful happened as I realised that those pulses were travelling from left to right (I was on the right-hand side of the audience) in a continuous wash; that harshness was now something more soothing, though still not an easy ride. It was hypnotic, and I lost track of time; when abruptly the pulses changed &#8211; the guitarists were now in synch and the sound was tumbling forward from them rather than across the performance area &#8211; I reckoned maybe 20 minutes had passed but in hindsight it was probably more like 45. After a while more the reverb began to fall away, and soon we were down to bare picked notes and then&#8230; nothing. For me, <i>Amplified</i> was a valuable lesson in how the impact of a minimalist work can often come from stepping back and appreciating the whole work, rather than (as we usually do with classical) listening from one moment to the next. And also a vivid demonstration of how sometimes it&#8217;s not the actual notes but the sound around the notes that becomes interesting.</p>
<p class="western">And that was just the first day.</p>
<p class="western">Day two began with a Bang on a Can Brunch, which is like a regular brunch but with the founders of a ground-breaking contemporary music organisation sitting in the corner being interviewed. The burger was delicious; the conversation was entertaining. John Schaeffer took the trio through the history of Bang on a Can, and there was time for one question from the audience (I&#8217;m paraphrasing: “Michael Gordon, do you agree with me that <i>Amplified</i> is just a butt-ugly stepchild of Steve Reich&#8217;s <i>Music for 18 Musicians</i>?”). Favourite anecdote: John Cage came to the first Bang on a Can show but left before they played the piece of his they&#8217;d programmed, because “it was past his bedtime”.</p>
<p class="western">So day two was a Bang on a Can Marathon, but David Lang told us we were getting off lightly: just four hours in the afternoon and two that night. Ten works were performed in the first session, the idea being that the audience could come and go as it pleased; I imagine that most of us heard everything, though. Why would you not? So Percussion opened the Marathon with <i>Music for Wood &amp; Strings</i> by Bryce Dessner, who&#8217;s becoming well-enough established as a composer that he soon won&#8217;t need to have “of The National” after his name all the time. The work uses four specially designed instruments resembling hammered dulcimers, and the ultimate sonic effect is that the percussionists sound a lot more like guitarists than you might reasonably expect. It&#8217;s a bitty sort of piece but falls easy on the ear. Chamber Choir Ireland gave us a short and lovely piece for sopranos and altos by the Dane Pelle Gudmundsen-Holmgreen, whose “new simplicity” style fitted well with the festival vibe. The RTÉ ConTempo Quartet (RTÉ is the state broadcaster) were next, with Garrett Sholdice&#8217;s <i>Das Blaue Licht, </i>a nice piece whose first part was entirely pizzicato; the quartet later played George Crumb&#8217;s grotesque/beautiful <i>Black Angels</i> from 1970 &#8211; another work that really benefits from <i>seeing</i> the performance. Bang on a Can All-Stars brought us two strong pieces: Kate Moore&#8217;s <i>Ridgeway</i>, a reflection on home and memory that sounded to me like a ghost parade, and Donnacha Dennehy&#8217;s characteristically punchy <i>Streetwalker.</i></p>

<p class="western">What else? The Crash Ensemble, of course. We heard Seán Clancy&#8217;s <i>14 minutes of music on the subject of greeting cards</i> (a melancholic birth-to-death journey, for piano, violin and flute) and Linda Buckley&#8217;s brand-new <i>Torann</i> (Irish for “noise”, inspired by the sea, an Icelandic volcano, and milking machines), but before those there was Andrew Hamilton&#8217;s <i>Music for people who like art</i>, described a few years ago by an Irish critic as “20 minutes of my life that I will never get back” and by me right now as 20 minutes of something like advertising jingles chopped up and repeated in a hard-driven and unpredictable way for a hilariously unconscionable amount of time, topped with a female voice quoting Ad Reinhardt&#8217;s “Art is Art” statement while also occasionaly screeching, choking and throwing up, that eventually and for no apparent reason transmogrifies into something like a horribly distorted half-remembered version of the Shangri-Las&#8217; “Leader of the Pack”. I have no idea what the composer intended, but I laughed all the way through.</p>
<p class="western">Oh, <i>and</i> Crash&#8217;s pianist Andrew Zolinsky played Meredith Monk&#8217;s <i>St. Petersburg Waltz.</i></p>
<div id="attachment_4928" style="width: 570px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/what-wow-david-langs-festival-of-music-in-dublin/irish-composers.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4928" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/what-wow-david-langs-festival-of-music-in-dublin/irish-composers-1024x768.jpg" alt="Q&amp;A with Irish composers.

<p class="western">Which leaves us with the final concert. Okay, I admit that with Brian Eno&#8217;s <i>Music for Airports</i> (in its Bang on a Can arrangement, of course) I came the closest to not liking, but it wasn&#8217;t the music itself that was the issue &#8211; it&#8217;s just that seeing as the whole point of the music is that it&#8217;s <i>background</i>, it felt at times too incongruous to be sitting in a packed concert hall listening carefully as if this were Brahms. But the All-Stars were great, the first part is a gorgeous thing, and the last featured some wonderful clarinetting from Ken Thomson; Evan Ziporyn&#8217;s contribution to the arrangement takes the music out of the “merely” ambient and turns it into a bona fide concert piece.</p>
<p class="western">And, to cap it all, Steve Reich&#8217;s <i>Music for 18 Musicians.</i> You don&#8217;t need me to tell you the significance of this work, or what it sounds like. All I want to say about the performance is this: imagine Steve Reich&#8217;s <i>Music for 18 Musicians </i>performed by So Percussion and various members of the Bang on a Can All-Stars, Chamber Choir Ireland, and the Crash Ensemble<i>.</i> <i>That&#8217;s</i> how good it was. A triumphant end to a wonderful two days of music-making.</p>

The usual caveats apply regarding how representative of the year&#8217;s releases this is, with the added proviso that I tend to avoid new recordings of repertoire that&#8217;s already in my collection, which brings the selection somewhat away from the mainstream. That said, I&#8217;ve covered a lot of ground and the 15 albums collectively serve to demonstrate just how broad the term “classical music” is—and how <em>new</em> centuries-old music can sound.</p>
<p class="western"><b>#1.</b></p>
<p class="western"><b>Anna Prohaska. Behind the Lines [DG]</b></p>
<p class="western">The Austrian soprano marks the centenary of the First World War, with a selection of songs spanning several centuries and countries. From the opening folk song segueing into a piece from Beethoven&#8217;s “Egmont” music, through such varied composers as Roger Quilter and Wolfgang Rihm, to the final pair of Whitman settings by Kurt Weill, Prohaska is always at home. A superb, moving recital.<span id="more-4796"></span></p>
<p class="western"><b><a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/top-15-old-classical-of-2014-stephen-j-nereffid/brodsky.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4798" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/top-15-old-classical-of-2014-stephen-j-nereffid/brodsky.jpg" alt="brodsky" width="150" height="149" srcset="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/top-15-old-classical-of-2014-stephen-j-nereffid/brodsky.jpg 200w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/top-15-old-classical-of-2014-stephen-j-nereffid/brodsky-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a>#2.</b></p>
<p class="western"><b>Brodsky Quartet. New World Quartets [Chandos]</b></p>
<p class="western">A joyful account of Dvořák&#8217;s “American” quartet (composed in Iowa) kicks off a collection of otherwise “genuine” American works, including a fine pair from Copland that I&#8217;d never heard before. The Brodskys give a superb rendition of Barber&#8217;s quartet, including a blazing Adagio (yes, <i>the</i> Adagio). Gershwin, Brubeck, and Copland&#8217;s Hoe-Down round off the show.</p>
<p class="western"><b><a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/top-15-old-classical-of-2014-stephen-j-nereffid/roth.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4810" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/top-15-old-classical-of-2014-stephen-j-nereffid/roth.jpg" alt="roth" width="150" height="137" /></a>#3.</b></p>
<p class="western"><b>Linus Roth. Britten &amp; Weinberg: Violin concertos [Challenge]</b></p>
<p class="western">The first movement of Weinberg&#8217;s 1959 concerto turned out to be my most-played track of the year. I continue to resist the temptation to go on a massive binge of discovering Weinberg&#8217;s music; my restraint is rewarded by discoveries such as this. I agree with Roth: this concerto fully deserves a place in the repertoire. Oh yes, and the Britten is splendid too!</p>
<p class="western"><b><a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/top-15-old-classical-of-2014-stephen-j-nereffid/hope.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4802" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/top-15-old-classical-of-2014-stephen-j-nereffid/hope.jpg" alt="hope" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/top-15-old-classical-of-2014-stephen-j-nereffid/hope.jpg 200w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/top-15-old-classical-of-2014-stephen-j-nereffid/hope-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a>#4.</b></p>
<p class="western"><b>Daniel Hope. Escape to Paradise [DG]</b></p>
<p class="western">Subtitled “The Hollywood Album”, this is another cleverly put-together themed album from Hope (see last year&#8217;s “Spheres”). The basic concept is that this is music from composers who fled Europe in the thirties and ended up in Hollywood, though even the booklet notes admit the notion must be hugely stretched to accommodate some of the selections. No matter: beauty and charm abound.</p>
<p class="western"><b><a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/top-15-old-classical-of-2014-stephen-j-nereffid/rameau.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4809" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/top-15-old-classical-of-2014-stephen-j-nereffid/rameau.jpg" alt="rameau" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/top-15-old-classical-of-2014-stephen-j-nereffid/rameau.jpg 244w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/top-15-old-classical-of-2014-stephen-j-nereffid/rameau-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a>#5.</b></p>
<p class="western"><b>Teodor Currentzis. Rameau: The Sound of Light [Sony]</b></p>
<p class="western">2014 marked the 250th anniversary of Jean-Philippe Rameau&#8217;s death, though I didn&#8217;t see much increased activity in the recording world. A pity. This selection of (mostly) instrumental music performed by Currentzis and MusicAeterna is full of life (and light) and should win new fans for Rameau and French baroque music generally.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="western"><b><a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/top-15-old-classical-of-2014-stephen-j-nereffid/mints.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4805" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/top-15-old-classical-of-2014-stephen-j-nereffid/mints.jpg" alt="mints" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/top-15-old-classical-of-2014-stephen-j-nereffid/mints.jpg 200w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/top-15-old-classical-of-2014-stephen-j-nereffid/mints-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a>#6.</b></p>
<p class="western"><b>Roman Mints. Dance of Shadows [Quartz]</b></p>
<p class="western">A solo album from this Russian violinist who can always be relied on to produce an intriguing program. Studio trickery plays with perspective in Ysaÿe&#8217;s second sonata, and Mints accompanies himself on hurdy-gurdy in Dobrinka Tabakova&#8217;s “Spinning a Yarn”. His pleasingly raw tone is ideal for the pieces by Piazzolla (unexpectedly desolate), Schnittke (thrilling), and Silvestrov (haunting).</p>
<p class="western"><b><a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/top-15-old-classical-of-2014-stephen-j-nereffid/dinnerstein.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4800" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/top-15-old-classical-of-2014-stephen-j-nereffid/dinnerstein.jpg" alt="dinnerstein" width="150" height="149" srcset="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/top-15-old-classical-of-2014-stephen-j-nereffid/dinnerstein.jpg 200w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/top-15-old-classical-of-2014-stephen-j-nereffid/dinnerstein-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a>#7.</b></p>
<p class="western"><b>Simone Dinnerstein. Bach: Inventions and Sinfonias [Sony]</b></p>
<p class="western">Being honest, I have to say that pretty much <i>any</i> performance of Bach piano music stands a reasonable chance of making it onto a best-of-the-year list; there&#8217;s something so “just right” about it. Angela Hewitt&#8217;s “Art of Fugue” on Hyperion was a contender too, but the charm of these smaller pieces won it for Dinnerstein.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="western"><b><a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/top-15-old-classical-of-2014-stephen-j-nereffid/prometheus.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4808" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/top-15-old-classical-of-2014-stephen-j-nereffid/prometheus.jpg" alt="prometheus" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/top-15-old-classical-of-2014-stephen-j-nereffid/prometheus.jpg 200w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/top-15-old-classical-of-2014-stephen-j-nereffid/prometheus-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a>#8.</b></p>
<p class="western"><b>George Petrou/Armonia Atenea. Beethoven: Prometheus [Decca]</b></p>
<p class="western">Aside from the overture, the rest of Beethoven&#8217;s 1801 ballet “The Creatures of Prometheus” was unknown territory for me; what a delight to hear a “new” work from an old friend. It&#8217;s vibrantly played on period instruments by this Greek orchestra. Highlights include an oh-so-Beethoven Pastorale and the finale, where the glorious “Eroica” theme makes its appearance.</p>
<p class="western"><b><a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/top-15-old-classical-of-2014-stephen-j-nereffid/inspired.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4803" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/top-15-old-classical-of-2014-stephen-j-nereffid/inspired.jpg" alt="inspired" width="150" height="149" srcset="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/top-15-old-classical-of-2014-stephen-j-nereffid/inspired.jpg 200w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/top-15-old-classical-of-2014-stephen-j-nereffid/inspired-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a>#9.</b></p>
<p class="western"><b>Stefan Temmingh &amp; Dorothee Mields. Inspired by Song [DHM]</b></p>
<p class="western">Temmingh&#8217;s recorder alternates with Mields&#8217;s soprano in a collection of popular (then and/or now) “baroque tunes and English songs”. It&#8217;s really Temmingh&#8217;s project, and his full-bodied playing sounds wonderful (as do the other musicians), but Mields steals the show for me, with a voice and singing personality that reminds me of Emma Kirkby.</p>
<p class="western"><b><a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/top-15-old-classical-of-2014-stephen-j-nereffid/novak.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4806" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/top-15-old-classical-of-2014-stephen-j-nereffid/novak.jpg" alt="novak" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/top-15-old-classical-of-2014-stephen-j-nereffid/novak.jpg 200w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/top-15-old-classical-of-2014-stephen-j-nereffid/novak-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a>#10.</b></p>
<p class="western"><b>Martinů Voices. Novak: Testamentum [Supraphon]</b></p>
<p class="western">Four works for small vocal ensemble by Czech composer Jan Novák, written between 1966 and 1974; for some reason I&#8217;d got him mixed up with his late-Romantic compatriot <span lang="en">Vítězslav, so it was a pleasant surprise to be set right. All four pieces are in Latin, which usually means church music, but in fact only one is religious in nature—the delightful Christmas work “Invitatio pastorum”.</span></p>
<p class="western"><b><a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/top-15-old-classical-of-2014-stephen-j-nereffid/bruggen.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4799" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/top-15-old-classical-of-2014-stephen-j-nereffid/bruggen.jpg" alt="bruggen" width="150" height="134" /></a>#11.</b></p>
<p class="western"><b>Frans Brüggen. Mozart: Symphonies nos.39-41 [Glossa]</b></p>
<p class="western">Brüggen, one of the greats of the early-music movement, died in August, and this recording with the Orchestra of the 18th Century (which he co-founded over thirty years ago) makes a fine memorial. This is big, grand Mozart, performed live in vivid sound. The slow movement of the “Jupiter” symphony is a thing of extraordinary beauty.</p>

<p class="western">Of course it doesn&#8217;t need saying that she&#8217;s an artist in her own right, but my goodness Arianna Savall can sound very like her mother, Montserrat Figueras. This can only be high praise, obviously, and that marvelous combination of earthy and ethereal is perfect for Hildegard&#8217;s music. Variety is provided by Johansen&#8217;s tenor in a lament by Peter Abelard, along with some very apt, newly created, instrumental “meditations”.</p>
<p class="western"><b><a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/top-15-old-classical-of-2014-stephen-j-nereffid/madness.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4804" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/top-15-old-classical-of-2014-stephen-j-nereffid/madness.jpg" alt="madness" width="150" height="134" /></a>#13.</b></p>
<p class="western"><b>Calmus Ensemble. Madrigals of Madness [Carus]</b></p>
<p class="western">This is the first in an intriguing-sounding series of madrigals devoted to specific emotions. Here we get vividly theatrical performances of pieces addressing the madness of love (not surprisingly, Monteverdi and Gesualdo), war (some highly animated spectaculars by Josquin, Janequin, and Flecha), and loneliness (the melancholic Englishmen Gibbons and Tomkins).</p>
<p class="western"><b><a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/top-15-old-classical-of-2014-stephen-j-nereffid/wood-works.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4811" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/top-15-old-classical-of-2014-stephen-j-nereffid/wood-works.jpg" alt="wood works" width="150" height="134" /></a>#14.</b></p>
<p class="western"><b>Danish String Quartet. Wood Works [Dacapo]</b></p>
<p class="western">There was plenty of folk-inspired music on my new-music list, so here&#8217;s some more. The Danish String Quartet offer their take on some of their favourite tunes from Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and the Faroe Islands; there&#8217;s even a few new compositions. Successfully combining two musical worlds, this is honest, affectionate music-making.</p>
<p class="western"><b><a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/top-15-old-classical-of-2014-stephen-j-nereffid/amorosi.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4797" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/top-15-old-classical-of-2014-stephen-j-nereffid/amorosi.jpg" alt="amorosi" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/top-15-old-classical-of-2014-stephen-j-nereffid/amorosi.jpg 200w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/top-15-old-classical-of-2014-stephen-j-nereffid/amorosi-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a>#15.</b></p>
<p class="western"><b>Cinquecento. Amorosi Pensieri [Hyperion]</b></p>
<p class="western">The six-man group Cinquecento has been performing a great service by resurrecting unknown music from the 1500s as the ensemble&#8217;s name implies). Here they present secular songs in Italian, French and German by four composers at the Hapsburg court: de Monte, Guyot, Vaet and Regnart. Aside from the historical interest, though, these performances are wonderfully pure and fresh.</p>

I&#8217;m defining “new” music simply as music written by people who are still alive, though the bulk of what appears here is from the present century. If you know nothing about contemporary classical, let me assure you that my list is utterly unrepresentative of the overall state of the art. So, with that in mind&#8230;</p>
<p class="western"><strong>#1. </strong></p>
<p class="western"><strong>John Allemeier. Deep Water: The Murder Ballads [Albany]</strong></p>
<p class="western">Ellen Smith, shot through the heart; Frankie Silver, who killed her abusive husband with his own gun and then dismembered him; and Omie Wise, seduced and drowned by a wealthy young man. Three folk songs from North Carolina inspired John Allemeier and choreographer E.E. Balcos to create a darkly lyrical trio of chamber works that together make a single piece of dance theatre. This is vivid music that doesn&#8217;t need to be seen to be believed.</p>
<p class="western"><span id="more-4754"></span></p>
<p class="western"><a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/best-of-2014-new-classical-music/wolfe.jpg"><img class="alignleft wp-image-4755 size-thumbnail" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/best-of-2014-new-classical-music/wolfe-150x150.jpg" alt="wolfe" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/best-of-2014-new-classical-music/wolfe-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/best-of-2014-new-classical-music/wolfe-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/best-of-2014-new-classical-music/wolfe.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a><strong>#2. </strong></p>
<p class="western"><strong>Julia Wolfe. Steel Hammer [Cantaloupe]</strong></p>
<p class="western">Julia Wolfe picks apart the many variations of “John Henry” and reconstructs them all into an extraordinary monument. The work burns slowly to begin with—it takes nearly ten minutes just to get done with the first four words—but the fateful race is genuinely climactic. The Bang On A Can All-Stars provide support for the inspired Trio Medieval in a work that&#8217;s billed by the label as “alt-folk”, though to me “epic minimalism” is probably a better pigeon-hole.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="western"><strong>John Luther Adams. Become Ocean [Cantaloupe]</strong></p>
<p class="western">A vast, slowly rolling orchestral work that perfectly lives up to its title. I&#8217;ve heard it described by a baffled listener as “nothing happens”, which is correct only if you think that nothing happens in an ocean. It won this year&#8217;s Pulitzer Prize for music, which I guess in and of itself means little, but “Become Ocean” has the air of an instant classic about it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="western"><a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/best-of-2014-new-classical-music/glass.jpg"><img class="alignleft wp-image-4762 size-thumbnail" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/best-of-2014-new-classical-music/glass-150x150.jpg" alt="glass" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/best-of-2014-new-classical-music/glass-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/best-of-2014-new-classical-music/glass-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/best-of-2014-new-classical-music/glass.jpg 687w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a><strong>#4. </strong></p>
<p class="western"><strong>The Dublin Guitar Quartet performs Philip Glass [Orange Mountain]</strong></p>
<p class="western">These are the DGQ&#8217;s own arrangements of Glass&#8217;s 2nd to 5th string quartets, released on the composer&#8217;s own label so he clearly approves. I love the sounds produced here, which inspire in me the possibly heretical thought that these versions actually improve on the originals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="western"><a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/best-of-2014-new-classical-music/crumb.jpg"><img class="alignleft wp-image-4759 size-thumbnail" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/best-of-2014-new-classical-music/crumb-150x150.jpg" alt="crumb" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/best-of-2014-new-classical-music/crumb-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/best-of-2014-new-classical-music/crumb-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/best-of-2014-new-classical-music/crumb.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a><strong>#5. </strong></p>
<p class="western"><strong>George Crumb. Voices from the Heartland [Bridge]</strong></p>
<p class="western">The title work is the seventh (and last) volume of Crumb&#8217;s American Songbook, his unique collection of song settings, here ranging from “On Top of Old Smokey” to Navajo chants, the latter forming a piece called “Song of the Earth”. Maybe not a Mahler reference, but in its way Crumb&#8217;s often-mysterious, always-surprising take on the commonplace merits comparison to that composer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="western"><a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/best-of-2014-new-classical-music/nyman.jpg"><img class="alignleft wp-image-4768 size-thumbnail" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/best-of-2014-new-classical-music/nyman-150x150.jpg" alt="nyman" width="150" height="150" /></a><strong>#6. </strong></p>
<p class="western"><strong>Valentina Lisitsa. Chasing Pianos &#8211; music of Michael Nyman [Decca]</strong></p>
<p class="western">After recent albums of Rachmaninov and Liszt, I&#8217;m not sure if the high-profile pianist&#8217;s foray into Nyman&#8217;s soundtrack minimalism—“The Piano” inevitably provides the backbone, but there&#8217;s much more besides—counts as a brave move or a crossover sell-out. It certainly sounds wholly genuine to me. Oh, and Paul Morley&#8217;s booklet note is a marvel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="western"><a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/best-of-2014-new-classical-music/american-vernacular.jpg"><img class="alignleft wp-image-4758 size-thumbnail" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/best-of-2014-new-classical-music/american-vernacular-150x150.jpg" alt="american vernacular" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/best-of-2014-new-classical-music/american-vernacular-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/best-of-2014-new-classical-music/american-vernacular-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/best-of-2014-new-classical-music/american-vernacular.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a><strong>#7. </strong></p>
<p class="western"><strong>Nicholas Phillips. American Vernacular &#8211; New Music for Solo Piano [New Focus]</strong></p>
<p class="western">“The idea was simple, really”, the pianist explains in the booklet: he asked a bunch of composers to write something that might reach a wide audience, with just the theme “American vernacular”. The result is a fascinating sampler of styles and emotions, with inspiration ranging from John Fahey to the night sky to Trayvon Martin.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="western"><strong>Tristan Perich. Surface Image [New Amsterdam]</strong></p>
<p class="western">An hour-long work for piano (Vicky Chow&#8217;s the pianist) with 1-bit electronics. Yes, it will doubtless remind you of Steve Reich, and there seems to be a direct nod to Terry Riley&#8217;s “In C” at one point, but the electronics brings us to so many fantastic places that the piece feels wholly fresh.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="western"><a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/best-of-2014-new-classical-music/gordon.jpg"><img class="alignleft wp-image-4763 size-thumbnail" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/best-of-2014-new-classical-music/gordon-150x150.jpg" alt="gordon" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/best-of-2014-new-classical-music/gordon-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/best-of-2014-new-classical-music/gordon-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/best-of-2014-new-classical-music/gordon.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a><strong>#9. </strong></p>
<p class="western"><strong>Michael Gordon. Rushes [Cantaloupe]</strong></p>
<p class="western">Goodness me yes, more minimalism! This one might <i>sound</i> electronic, but the textures you hear are brought to you by seven bassoons, providing a gently shifting ambience intended to evoke a trance-like experience, in which regard Gordon&#8217;s wholly successful.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="western"><a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/best-of-2014-new-classical-music/hytta.jpg"><img class="alignleft wp-image-4764 size-thumbnail" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/best-of-2014-new-classical-music/hytta-150x150.jpg" alt="hytta" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/best-of-2014-new-classical-music/hytta-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/best-of-2014-new-classical-music/hytta-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/best-of-2014-new-classical-music/hytta.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a><strong>#10. </strong></p>
<p class="western"><strong>Anne Hytta. Draumsyn [Carpe Diem]</strong></p>
<p class="western">Hmm, maybe this isn&#8217;t classical as such, but who&#8217;s counting? Anne Hytta plays the hardanger fiddle of her native Norway in a collection of her own compositions, inspired by &#8220;imagining landscapes without people&#8221;. You might call most of these pieces melancholic or dark-hued, but the playing is full of warmth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="western"><strong>James MacMillan. Visions of a November Spring [Delphian]</strong></p>
<p class="western">MacMillan&#8217;s been a favourite composer for a while but I&#8217;d not listened to him much lately. This intense group of pieces from the Edinburgh Quartet has prompted renewed enthusiasm. It&#8217;s a quite recent purchase so I haven&#8217;t fully absorbed it yet, but it&#8217;s certainly a keeper; ask me again in a year and it might well place a lot higher in the list.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="western"><strong>Meredith Monk. Piano Songs [ECM New Series]</strong></p>
<p class="western">Pianists Ursula Oppens and Bruce Brubaker share the honours in what you might call a career-spanning selection of mostly duets and some solo pieces. Monk&#8217;s characteristic, and indeed idiosyncratic, features of driving rhythms and sad beauty are on full display.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="western"><strong>Nicole Lizée. Bookburners [Centrediscs]</strong></p>
<p class="western">Lizées&#8217;s &#8216;Hitchcock Preludes” is a magnificent collision in which soundtrack snippets are repurposed in startling ways, underscored and commented on by a piano. If the rest of the album—more eclectic electroacoustic works—doesn&#8217;t quite live up to this gleeful insanity, it&#8217;s never less than fascinating.</p>

<p class="western"><strong>Jonathan Dove. All You Who Sleep Tonight: Song Cycles [Naxos]</strong></p>
<p class="western">The English song tradition is alive and well, as evidenced by these four cycles, settings of texts by, respectively, the late tenor Robert Tear, Lorca, Shakespeare, and Vikram Seth. Dove&#8217;s probably best known for his operas, and these songs display the same lyricism and sensitivity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="western"><a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/best-of-2014-new-classical-music/dennehy.jpg"><img class="alignleft wp-image-4760 size-thumbnail" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/best-of-2014-new-classical-music/dennehy-150x150.jpg" alt="dennehy" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/best-of-2014-new-classical-music/dennehy-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/best-of-2014-new-classical-music/dennehy-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/best-of-2014-new-classical-music/dennehy.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a><strong>#15. </strong></p>
<p class="western"><strong>Donnacha Dennehy. Crane/O/The Vandal/Hive [RTÉ Lyric FM]</strong></p>
<p class="western">Three muscular and boisterous works of orchestral post-minimalism, and a fourth that matches that description but also includes a choir. If I can compare an entire album to someone else&#8217;s short work, I&#8217;d say we&#8217;re not a huge distance from John Adams&#8217;s “Short Ride in a Fast Machine”, but these rides are longer and the machines bigger and more liable to crash and explode.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I didn’t listen to everything this year. Neither did you. I have no objective way of knowing that these are (or are not) the 20 best albums released this year. Neither do you. But these are the ones I most loved and most want to spend more time with next year, and who knows, maybe you’ll find something special here too, something you missed but can connect with and find riches in, something off your usual menu that you might come to be thankful for. If that happens even once, the list will be worthwhile. And as always, if any of the musicians drop by, thank you for the work, care, commitment, and creativity represented below.<span id="more-4679"></span></p>

<strong>#1. Porya Hatami – Shallow</strong><br />
Iran’s Porya Hatami had an enormously productive year – at least eight releases by my count. This was the first and is still my favorite. Hatami takes field recordings, gentle drones, bright chiming flutters of notes, and builds them into an enchanting and unusually well composed ambient symphony that I have been listening to all year without tiring. The irregular patters of sound unfold within an overall structure that creates a sense of focus and development. Just beautiful, a true gift.

<strong>#2. Pjusk – Solstøv</strong><br />
I am an unabashed Pjusk fan, and this pushed <em>Shallow</em> close for the number one slot. Pjusk continue their distinctive weaving of dusk and landscape and luminous pulses and this time add processed trumpet to conjure breath and light in the airy transitions of morning and evening. Glimpse, faded, dawn, bewitching, veil, glow &#8211; the track titles suggest the elusive textures that the music seeks to evoke. Detailed and evocative, the newest Pjusk album is as finely wrought as their back catalog.

<strong>#3. Tord Gustavsen Quartet – Extended Circle</strong><br />
A second entry from Norway, this has been my most played jazz release of 2014. At the heart of it is Gustavsen’s distinctively languid piano playing, weaving innocuous seeming tunes with such a sensitive touch and timing that they float deliciously and linger tenderly in the subconscious.

<strong>#4. Rafael Anton Irisarri – The Unintentional Sea</strong><br />
In some ways the opposite of Christopher Bissonnette’s album in its aesthetic, The Unintentional Sea flows through hazy, grainy curtains of delicately layered sound. Deep trembling tones and hidden crackles and rustles hint at great themes unfolding and give way to melancholy swells of subdued melody. The whole is graceful and sensitive, perfect for times of quiet solitude and reflection.

<strong>#5. Christopher Bissonnette – Essays in Idleness</strong><br />
This one was a delightful surprise, a hugely rewarding departure from the sound of Bissonnette’s enjoyable previous releases. Here he takes a homemade synthesizer and weaves its bright, distinctive sounds into starkly expressive crystalline meditations. The sounds are cold and alien, yet strangely eloquent and human. One of the more distinctive releases of this year. Listen to music from <em>Essays in Idleness </em><a href="https://soundcloud.com/kranky/christopher-bissonnette">here</a>.</p>

<strong>#6. Otto A. Totland &#8211; Piño</strong><br />
Otto Totland&#8217;s reflective piano meditations are familiar to fans of Deaf Center, his recording duo with Erik Skodvin. Here we are treated to a whole album of gently brooding piano compositions, warm and still and human, perfect for a mellow late evening. The sound is intimate, and it is no surprise to find that Nils Frahm had a hand in the recording process. Listen to a track <a href="http://www.sonicpieces.com/sonicpieces019.html">here</a>.</p>

<strong>#7. Janek Schaefer &#8211; Lay-by Lullaby</strong><br />
The early hours of the morning, at the side of the road, drifting, half awake, snatches of static and random radio melodies, cars swishing by, a state between times and places, subtly captured in ghostly, caressing sounds. Deeply evocative. Listen to some tracks <a href="http://www.12k.com/index.php/site/releases/lay-by_lullaby/" class="broken_link">here</a>.</p>

<strong>#8. Loscil &#8211; Sea Island</strong><br />
A welcome return to the core loscil sound, this latest album weaves the characteristic gently hypnotic tones and rhythms around an evocation of the tensions surrounding an island, once home to a Native American tribe, that now houses Vancouver airport and a nature preserve. Beauty, melancholy and an underlying tension combine with the song titles into a thought-provoking implied narrative.

<strong>#9. Chick Corea Trio &#8211; Trilogy </strong><br />
Pianist Corea is joined by bassist Christian McBride and drummer Brian Blade for three CDs filled with scintillating live recordings made around the world.

<strong>#10. Tinariwen &#8211; Emmaar</strong><br />
The throaty vocals, snaking melody lines, and bluesy guitars are all in full force on this latest from the Tuareg maestros, but more than anything it&#8217;s the intricately insistent rhythms that grab me by the ears and make my poor Western body want to move in more than one direction at once. A compelling glimpse into another musical dialect, seasoned with just enough of the West to provide a bridge.

<strong>#11. Ian William Craig &#8211; A Turn of Breath</strong><br />
Billed as &#8220;twelve works for voice and 1/4″ tape&#8221;, the melodic beauty of a trained male tenor duets with a medium that encases it in loops and decays into distortion, creating a broken patchwork through which the vocal melody shines like shafts of sunlight through winter cloud.

<strong>#12. Pascal Savy &#8211; Adrift</strong><br />
This almost feels like a companion album to the Rafael Anton Irisarri release &#8211; ocean-themed, built on finely textured, mysteriously swirling mists of sound with hints of strings, evoking a softly swelling place, numinous, and without horizon. Ominous moments and hints of the chaotic power of the elements resolve ultimately in a quiet disappearance into the fog. Listen <a href="https://eileanrec.bandcamp.com/album/adrift">here</a>.</p>

<strong>#13. Illuha &#8211; Akari</strong><br />
A little more austere in places than their somewhat lusher previous work, this latest from duo Illuha continues their focus on rustling, glistening landscapes of tiny sounds, inviting the listener to slow, to linger, to notice little, fragile shards of light and welcome them in silence. It embodies pleasure in the discovery of small beauties. Listen to a track <a href="http://www.12k.com/index.php/site/releases/akari/">here</a>.</p>

<strong>#14. Thomas Köner &#8211; Tiento de las Nieves</strong><br />
A departure from Köner&#8217;s accustomed arctic wastes of sonic near-absence, this 68 minute piece recalls compositions such as Michael Nyman&#8217;s Decay Music that work by letting single piano gestures decay into stillness instead of sustaining motion by hurrying into one another. Köner adds a focus on bringing deep resonances to the fore, conjuring haunting extended tones from the slide into silence.

<strong>#15. Kate Carr &#8211; The Kakapo </strong><br />
I am cheating slightly with this one, letting it stand for a series reaching back into late 2012. Kate Carr commissioned 12 ambient works for 3&#8243; CD, each focused on a specific bird. Taking us beyond the well-trodden path of random birdsong used to adorn relaxation music, the series yielded an array of fascinating compositions each saying something about a specific feathered creature and our relationship to it. Carr&#8217;s meditation on the kakapo, an endangered flightless parrot, brought the visionary series to a satisfying close.

<strong>#16. Avishai Cohen &#8211; Dark Nights</strong><br />
This album by rising jazz trumpeter Cohen had me hooked from its plaintively bluesy, tensely brooding opening notes. The rest of the album soars and wanders through varying styles and moods, all conveying passion without bluster and an accessible yet rigorous honesty.

<strong>#17. René Margraff &#8211; Phasen</strong><br />
The album&#8217;s title suggests states of being rather than stories, and indeed each track by René Margraff focuses more on a particular texture than on constructing movement. As I listen to each hazily droning modulation of noise I find myself thinking of it as the atmosphere of a room in an abandoned building, each with its own space and debris and pattern of dusty sunlight and dim atmosphere.

<strong>#18. Peter Rosendal &#8211; Love for Snail</strong><br />
The title and cover offer clues to the sheer quirky difference of this album, which seems determined to figure out how many diverse ways it can make a catchy tune without losing its sense of offbeat surprise at the fresh sounds that music can make. It&#8217;s jazz of an idiosyncratic, impish bent, and it makes me smile. I couldn&#8217;t find a public stream, but it&#8217;s on the major music services.</p>

<strong>#19. Marcin Wasilewski Trio with Joakim Milder &#8211; Spark of Life</strong><br />
I have been a fan for a while of this trio&#8217;s music and of Wasilewski&#8217;s approach to the piano. This latest release slides more easily into the background than earlier efforts, but contains plenty of beauty when given full attention. I never would have believed that a jazz piano trio treatment of The Police&#8217;s <em>Message in a Bottle</em> would ever be my favorite track on an album&#8230; Listen <a href="http://player.ecmrecords.com/spark-of-life">here</a>.</p>

<strong>#20. Lawrence English &#8211; Wilderness of Mirrors</strong><br />
Exploring sonic territory similar to some of Tim Hecker’s work, English offers here a series of exercises in controlled fury, a measured gusting of swirling noise punctuated with the ominous hum of absence. Finely crafted, dramatic, at some points even awe-inspiring. Listen<a href="https://soundcloud.com/room40/the-liquid-casket?in=room40/sets/lawrence-english-wilderness"> here</a>.</p>

<p class="western">While the Renaissance is regarded as having begun in Italy in the 14th century, convention has it that “Renaissance music” begins in the Low Countries and northern France in the 15th. Part of the reason for this discrepancy is that whereas the art and literature of the Renaissance and of the classical period that inspired it had long been studied, the same wasn&#8217;t true of music. Until the 19th century, the music of the past tended to stay in the past, unperformed, and it wasn&#8217;t until the 20th century that there was much general interest in “early music” (broadly, anything before about 1750). Such music had literally to be rediscovered, and the music of trecento Italy simply wasn&#8217;t known about when ideas of “Renaissance music” were first considered. So perhaps Landini and his contemporaries should be called the first Renaissance composers; but convention has sided with the theorist Johannes Tinctoris (c1435-1511), who was dismissive of all music prior to the 15th century and considered music to have been reborn in his time. Spearheading this apparent rebirth were the composers of what&#8217;s called the Franco-Flemish school, beginning with Dufay and Binchois and ending over a century later. Like Dufay, many of these composers spent at least some of their careers in Italy or other parts of Europe, and the widespread diffusion of their works (aided greatly by the invention of printing) helped to create an international style of music. <span id="more-4526"></span>We&#8217;ll be spending several chapters looking at the various developments in both vocal and instrumental music up to the end of the 16th century. To start us off, “The Art of the Netherlands” gives a useful overview of the secular and sacred music of the Franco-Flemish school, and it also provides a classic example of the work done by the pioneers of the early music revival. First issued in 1976, this album, like many others from David Munrow&#8217;s Early Music Consort, presented vivid performances of music that at the time would have been quite foreign to most listeners.</p>
<p class="western"><b><a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/into-the-renaissance/hcmr045requiems.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4532" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/into-the-renaissance/hcmr045requiems.jpg" alt="hcmr045requiems" width="200" height="177" /></a>Ockeghem &amp; la Rue: Requiems. </b><i>Cappella Pratensis.</i> Challenge (<a href="http://www.challengerecords.com/products/1322744539/" target="_blank">link</a>)</p>
<p class="western">Johannes Ockeghem, born sometime in the early 15th century, was a native of Hainaut, a French-speaking part of modern Belgium that was then a Burgundian possession. He entered the French royal chapel in 1452 and served three kings (Charles VII, Louis IX, and Charles VIII); he died in 1497. He was highly praised in his lifetime not just for his compositions but also for his voice—he sang bass, which probably explains his interest in writing bass lines in his polyphony that were more expressive and lower-lying than those of earlier composers. One of Ockeghem&#8217;s distinctions today is that he composed the oldest surviving polyphonic setting of the Requiem, the mass for the dead (a setting by Dufay, mentioned in his will, may have been earlier, but it&#8217;s now lost). It&#8217;s not known when Ockeghem composed his Requiem, and the only extant copy doesn&#8217;t contain the final sections so it&#8217;s also not clear whether he set the whole mass. The setting employs what&#8217;s called paraphrase technique, making use of an elaborated version of a cantus firmus, in this case the tunes being the Gregorian chant settings of the texts. As befits the occasion, it&#8217;s more sombre music than would be heard in other mass settings, and Ockeghem often uses a sparse texture, sometimes with just two voices. Chronologically, the next setting of the Requiem appears to be that of Pierre de la Rue (c1452-1518), a native of Tournai who held various positions in the Low Countries before joining the renowned chapel of the Duchy of Burgundy in 1492, the duchy by now being under the control of the Habsburgs. He also spent some years in Spain in the service of Philip and Joanna of Castile. La Rue&#8217;s Requiem demonstrates that, like Ockeghem, he had a fondness for low voices.</p>
<p class="western"><b><a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/into-the-renaissance/hcmr046cuiusvis.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4533" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/into-the-renaissance/hcmr046cuiusvis.jpg" alt="hcmr046cuiusvis" width="200" height="182" /></a>Ockeghem: Missa cuiusvis toni.</b> <i>Ensemble Musica Nova/Lucien Kandel. </i>Aeon (<a href="http://www.outhere-music.com/en/albums/ockeghem-missa-cuiusvis-toni-aecd0753" target="_blank">link</a>)</p>
<p class="western">After his death, Ockeghem&#8217;s reputation rested on the technical skills displayed in some of his compositions. One such work is the <i>Missa cuiusvis toni</i>, which gives us the opportunity for a technical interlude that addresses at last an aspect of composition that might well have come up in the first chapter: the medieval modes. The modes corresponded to the scales produced by using only the white notes on a piano keyboard, and there were eight of them, numbered I to VIII and also given names that came from the ancient Greek musical modes, such as Dorian and Phrygian. Unlike our modern keys, which involve fixed pitches (so C major always starts on the pitch we call C), the modes were ways of representing pitch <i>relationships, </i>and they were distinguished by two particular notes: the “final”, which was the pitch on which the melody ended, and the “cofinal” or “dominant” or “reciting tone”, which was the pitch around which the melody was centered. Here&#8217;s the medieval composers&#8217; love of hierarchical organisation again: the eight modes came in four pairs of “authentic” and “plagal” modes, with the two modes of each pair having the same final but differing in their reciting tones. We need go no further into the theory except to remark that two more pairs were added in the 16th century, and it wasn&#8217;t until the 17th century that our familiar system of major and minor scales had become established. Ockeghem&#8217;s <i>Missa cuiusvis toni</i> (Mass in any mode) was composed without clefs, meaning it is singable in any of the four authentic modes, which is quite a feat because the same cadences won&#8217;t work in all modes. Ensemble Musica Nova performs all four versions of the mass, and while it might be conceded that Ockeghem&#8217;s technical achievement will be more obvious to a musicologist than to the general listener, the fact that each version begins at the same pitch makes it easy to hear how the music changes with each mode. It&#8217;s also worth considering whether medieval theorists were onto anything when they said that each of the modes imparted a particular mood to the music.</p>
<p class="western"><b><a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/into-the-renaissance/hcmr047josquinmotets.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4528" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/into-the-renaissance/hcmr047josquinmotets.jpg" alt="hcmr047josquinmotets" width="200" height="198" srcset="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/into-the-renaissance/hcmr047josquinmotets.jpg 200w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/into-the-renaissance/hcmr047josquinmotets-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" /></a>Josquin: Motets. </b><i>Dufay Ensemble/Eckehard Kiem. </i>Ars Musici</p>
<p class="western">And so we come to Josquin des Prez (c.1450-1521), who in his own time was seen as the greatest of all composers, and continues to hold an exalted status today. Martin Luther famously called Josquin “the master of the notes&#8230; other composers must do as the notes dictate”, while the Italian diplomat Cosimo Bartoli believed him to be music&#8217;s equivalent of Michelangelo, “alone and without a peer”. More recently Josquin has sometimes been spoken of as the Beethoven of the Renaissance, a towering individual who transformed music. It wasn&#8217;t just Josquin&#8217;s skills that established such a reputation; to some degree you could say he came along at the right time. This was the age of printing (of which we&#8217;ll hear more in a later chapter), which helped spread his music: Josquin was the first composer to have a printed volume devoted exclusively to his work (a collection of masses produced by Petrucci in 1502), and publishers were quite happy to attach his name to other people&#8217;s music to improve sales. Moreover, this was the age of humanism, when music ceased to be regarded as one of the mathematical arts and instead became one of the arts of rhetoric. Music now was less about applying rules and formulas and more about expression. Josquin&#8217;s motets clearly demonstrate this desire to communicate to the listener: rarely do you hear an extended melisma, because the text settings more closely resemble the natural flow of speech such that the music matches the syllables, rather than the syllables being drawn out to fit the music&#8217;s structure. Not only that, but the composer seeks to match the sound of the music with the meaning of the text; listen, for example, to Josquin&#8217;s <i>Miserere mei, Deus</i> (<i>Have mercy on me, O God</i>), with the sparse and plaintive textures of the opening words, repeated several times at different pitches; the clarity of the singing of the verses; and then the full choir returning as the opening words reappear as a refrain. Very few of Josquin&#8217;s compositions can be reliably dated, but this <i>Miserere</i> appears to be have written when he was in the employ of Ercole d&#8217;Este at Ferrara in 1503-4, and was perhaps inspired by the recent execution of the reforming cleric Savonarola.</p>

<p class="western">Josquin&#8217;s masses can be said to be more conservative in style than his motets, but then by their nature mass settings require a greater emphasis on structure. Nevertheless, with mass settings now in demand following the examples of Dufay, Ockeghem and their contemporaries, there was plenty of scope for innovation. The two masses recorded here use secular chansons for their cantus firmi, but in both cases Josquin uses not just one voice of the chanson to construct his mass, as was the norm with cantus firmus masses, but exploits all <i>three</i> voices. The resulting works are known as imitation or parody masses, and by the time of Josquin&#8217;s death the parody mass had begun to replace the cantus firmus mass. The specific technique of imitation, where a phrase in one voice is repeated in another voice, had long been used in music, but it became a prominent aspect of composition in Josquin&#8217;s time, a development that meant all voices in a piece were of equal importance. Because each of the mass movements took its ideas from the entire chanson or motet on which it was based, the mass could take on the characteristics of the model, not just its melodies but also its general structure, thus becoming a more individual work—particularly so if the model itself was already a highly individual piece such as a Josquin motet. Thus, each of Josquin&#8217;s masses can be seen as a distinct utterance in much the same way, Peter Phillips argues in his notes for the Tallis Scholars&#8217; album, as we view the symphonies of Beethoven.</p>

<p class="western">When Josquin got his job in Ferrara, his chief competitor for the position was the Flanders-born Heinrich Isaac; Ercole d&#8217;Este had been advised that Josquin was the better composer but that Isaac was more likely to compose to please his employer rather than himself. Isaac had been in the employ of Lorenzo de&#8217; Medici in Florence, and in 1496 he was appointed court composer (<i>Hofkomponist</i>) to the Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I—the first time anyone had been professionally employed specifically as a composer. Although Maximilian&#8217;s court was based in Vienna, Isaac had the freedom to travel and in fact spent much of the rest of his life (he died in 1517) in Florence. Also unusually among his musical peers, Isaac remained a layman and was married. In terms of surviving music, he&#8217;s rivaled only by Josquin in quantity, and he quite outstrips Josquin in variety. On his travels from Flanders to Italy to Germany, Isaac absorbed many styles, making him the most eclectic composer of his generation. Capilla Flamenca&#8217;s recording presents “a life in music”, following Isaac from a Franco-Flemish mass setting, through such Florentine items as music written for the Carnival, a mashup of local tunes, and a motet marking the death of his patron Lorenzo, to an audition piece for the post in Ferrara, to secular songs in German. It&#8217;s perhaps for his contributions to German music that Isaac&#8217;s fame has been most lasting; he was the first of the Franco-Flemish composers of polyphony to live there, and he helped to popularise the style while also contributing to particular local practices such as the creation of polyphonic settings of Mass Propers. You&#8217;ll recall that we haven&#8217;t mentioned Germany for quite some time in this history, but now it was being brought into the mainstream of European music.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yes, top 23: this was a very good year of classical releases for me, and it turns out that the number of albums I want to mention doesn&#8217;t correspond exactly with the number of fingers and toes I possess. To buck convention even further, I&#8217;m not going to rank the albums, aside from my favourite of the year. The usual provisos apply; the list is some distance away from being representative of the year&#8217;s classical releases as a whole.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/top-23-of-2013-stephen-j-nereffid/littleprince.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4340" alt="littleprince" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/top-23-of-2013-stephen-j-nereffid/littleprince.jpg" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/top-23-of-2013-stephen-j-nereffid/littleprince.jpg 200w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/top-23-of-2013-stephen-j-nereffid/littleprince-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a><strong>#1. Petitgirard: The Little Prince</strong><br />
<strong>Laurent Petitgirard conducting</strong><br />
<strong>(Naxos)</strong></p>
<p>A mysterious, sombre and beautiful ballet from 2010, based on the classic book. Petitgirard makes use of a choir and a handful of instrumentalists; if I describe the music as like a softer, French-accented Philip Glass, this doesn&#8217;t do it justice but at least might give you some idea of the sound-world.</p>
<p><span id="more-4333"></span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/top-23-of-2013-stephen-j-nereffid/spheres.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4350" alt="spheres" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/top-23-of-2013-stephen-j-nereffid/spheres.jpg" width="120" height="120" /></a><strong>“Spheres”</strong><br />
<strong>Daniel Hope</strong><br />
<strong>(Deutsche Grammophon)</strong><br />
OK, if I were assigning numbers to the rest of my list, this one would be #2. Some gorgeous and, let&#8217;s admit cheerfully, radio-friendly music here &#8211; the album&#8217;s aim is to reflect the idea of “the music of the spheres”, which it does through a handful of Baroque pieces and a selection of mostly minimalist modern works.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/top-23-of-2013-stephen-j-nereffid/violinlullabies.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4355" alt="violinlullabies" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/top-23-of-2013-stephen-j-nereffid/violinlullabies.jpg" width="120" height="120" /></a>“Violin Lullabies”<br />
Rachel Barton Pine<br />
(Cedille)</strong><br />
Beauty is the order of the day, too, with this wonderful collection which, though ostensibly aimed at the “new parents” market, shines enough new light on some familiar pieces (and highlights some less-well-known ones) to justify its existence for any fan of the violin.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/top-23-of-2013-stephen-j-nereffid/wagner.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4356" alt="wagner" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/top-23-of-2013-stephen-j-nereffid/wagner.jpg" width="120" height="120" /></a>“Wagner”<br />
Jonas Kaufmann<br />
(Decca)</strong><br />
2013 marked Wagner&#8217;s bicentenary, and Kaufmann is widely regarded as today&#8217;s leading Wagner tenor, so I suppose that makes this album &#8211; a selection of scenes and arias, plus the <em>Wesendonck Lieder</em>, usually sung by a soprano &#8211; my most “mainstream” album of the year.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/top-23-of-2013-stephen-j-nereffid/mahlergerhaher.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4341" alt="mahlergerhaher" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/top-23-of-2013-stephen-j-nereffid/mahlergerhaher.jpg" width="120" height="120" /></a>Mahler: Orchestral Songs<br />
Christian Gerhaher<br />
(Sony)</strong><br />
Something of a no-brainer, this one: Mahler&#8217;s my favourite composer, and baritone Gerhaher is probably my favourite singer of lieder. This doesn&#8217;t displace some classic recordings &#8211; and actually it&#8217;s not even Gerhaher&#8217;s best Mahler album &#8211; but everything went sufficiently right here, with help from conductor Kent Nagano.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/top-23-of-2013-stephen-j-nereffid/eisler.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4337" alt="eisler" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/top-23-of-2013-stephen-j-nereffid/eisler.jpg" width="120" height="120" /></a>Eisler: Lieder<br />
Matthias Goerne<br />
(Harmonia Mundi)</strong><br />
And if I had to pick a second-favourite baritone it would be Goerne, here singing a selection of songs by long-time Brecht collaborator Hanns Eisler, including his final work, the <em>Serious Songs</em> written in East Berlin in 1961-2.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/top-23-of-2013-stephen-j-nereffid/dvorak.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4336" alt="dvorak" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/top-23-of-2013-stephen-j-nereffid/dvorak.jpg" width="120" height="120" /></a>Dvořák: Stabat Mater<br />
Philippe Herreweghe conducting<br />
(Harmonia Mundi)</strong><br />
I&#8217;ve been listening to classical music long enough now that it&#8217;s unusual to have a first-time encounter with a significant work by one of the great composers. This large-scale choral work was inspired by the deaths of three of Dvořák&#8217;s children; it&#8217;s a dark piece that journeys to light.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/top-23-of-2013-stephen-j-nereffid/songsoldentimes.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4349" alt="songsoldentimes" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/top-23-of-2013-stephen-j-nereffid/songsoldentimes.jpg" width="120" height="120" /></a>“Songs of Olden Times”<br />
Heinavanker<br />
(Harmonia Mundi)</strong><br />
I&#8217;m a sucker for the sound of Estonian choral music, and this collection of “folk hymns and runic songs”, with contributions from conductor/composer Margo Kõlar, hits all the right buttons. Easily the loveliest choral album of the year.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/top-23-of-2013-stephen-j-nereffid/monteverdi.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4343" alt="monteverdi" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/top-23-of-2013-stephen-j-nereffid/monteverdi.jpg" width="120" height="120" /></a>Monteverdi: Heaven and Earth<br />
Robert King<br />
(Vivat)</strong><br />
Conductor Robert King revived his recording career this year with the launch of The King&#8217;s Consort&#8217;s new record label, Vivat. This selection of Monteverdi arias and madrigals certainly feels like the old band getting back together.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/top-23-of-2013-stephen-j-nereffid/iovidiinterra.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4339" alt="iovidiinterra" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/top-23-of-2013-stephen-j-nereffid/iovidiinterra.jpg" width="120" height="120" /></a>“Io vidi in terra”<br />
José Lemos<br />
(Sono Luminus)</strong><br />
Another year, another new countertenor to get excited about. Well, Brazilian José Lemos has been around for a while but this is the first time I&#8217;ve encountered his rich voice. Here he sings a variety of pieces from 17th-century Italy, aided by Jory Vinikour (harpsichord) and Deborah Fox (theorbo).</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/top-23-of-2013-stephen-j-nereffid/telemann.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4351" alt="telemann" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/top-23-of-2013-stephen-j-nereffid/telemann.jpg" width="120" height="120" /></a>Telemann: Hoffnung des Wiedersehens<br />
Dorothee Mields<br />
(DHM)</strong><br />
He wrote so much music, and so little of it is known: Telemann is a gift that keeps on giving. Unlike many collections of baroque opera arias, this one doesn&#8217;t offer vocal pyrotechnics, making it ideal for Mields&#8217;s gently pure soprano.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/top-23-of-2013-stephen-j-nereffid/bachreinvented.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4334" alt="bachreinvented" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/top-23-of-2013-stephen-j-nereffid/bachreinvented.jpg" width="120" height="120" /></a>“Bach Re-invented”<br />
Absolute Ensemble/Kristjan Järvi<br />
(Sony)</strong><br />
Three of Bach&#8217;s keyboard inventions (played by Simone Dinnerstein) provide the launching-pads for new kinda-jazz-rock-fusion-y works by Gene Pritsker, Daniel Schnyder and Tom Trapp. Is it <em>strictly</em> classical? Well, I guess it doesn&#8217;t so much cross boundaries as wholly ignore them.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/top-23-of-2013-stephen-j-nereffid/cassuto.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4335" alt="cassuto" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/top-23-of-2013-stephen-j-nereffid/cassuto.jpg" width="120" height="120" /></a>Cassuto: Return to the Future<br />
Álvaro Cassuto conducting<br />
(Naxos)</strong><br />
Portuguese conductor Cassuto wrote avant-garde music in the sixties, but the four works here from the succeeding two decades demonstrate his whole-hearted embrace of accessible tonality. There&#8217;s a real freshness to this music, notwithstanding its roots in the past.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/top-23-of-2013-stephen-j-nereffid/schafer.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4348" alt="schafer" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/top-23-of-2013-stephen-j-nereffid/schafer.jpg" width="120" height="120" /></a>Schafer: String quartets nos.8-12<br />
Quatuor Molinari<br />
(Atma)</strong><br />
This is my first exposure to the music of R Murray Schafer, five appealing works written over the past dozen years. Eight minutes into the opening track the quartet plays a Shostakovich-like dance accompanied by the sound of children playing; that&#8217;s the sort of thing that hooks me totally.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/top-23-of-2013-stephen-j-nereffid/thrum.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4352" alt="thrum" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/top-23-of-2013-stephen-j-nereffid/thrum.jpg" width="120" height="120" /></a>“Thrum”<br />
Minneapolis Guitar Quartet<br />
(Innova)</strong><br />
My tentative explorations of the classical guitar continue with this wonderfully evocative album, from Daniel Roumain&#8217;s music of American “ghettos” through David Evan Thomas&#8217;s relaxed title piece and Van Stiefel&#8217;s messing around with cowboy songs to Gao Hong&#8217;s depictions of life in southern China.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/top-23-of-2013-stephen-j-nereffid/fullpower.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4338" alt="fullpower" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/top-23-of-2013-stephen-j-nereffid/fullpower.jpg" width="120" height="120" /></a>“Full Power”<br />
Trombone Unit Hannover<br />
(Genuin)</strong><br />
From guitar quartet to trombone octet&#8230; Brass music isn&#8217;t often on my radar, but this album is an absolute joy. The seven works here, all of them recent or fairly recent, pretty much cover the spectrum from Wagnerian bombast to weird blaarts (but mostly the points in between). This is the most fun album of the year.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/top-23-of-2013-stephen-j-nereffid/transitions.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4353" alt="transitions" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/top-23-of-2013-stephen-j-nereffid/transitions.jpg" width="120" height="120" /></a>“Transitions”<br />
Olga Pashchenko<br />
(Fuga Libera)</strong><br />
With the help of a pair of great-sounding fortepianos, Pashchenko messes with our perceptions: here Mendelssohn and the not-so-well-known Dussek are the fiery Romantics, while Beethoven&#8217;s the charming classicist. If my list were confined to dead composers this album would be at the top.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/top-23-of-2013-stephen-j-nereffid/mompou.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4342" alt="mompou" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/top-23-of-2013-stephen-j-nereffid/mompou.jpg" width="120" height="120" /></a>Mompou: Piano music<br />
Arcadi Volodos<br />
(Sony)</strong><br />
The small-scale intimacies of Catalan composer Federico Mompou might seem unlikely fare for the Russian “supervirtuoso”, but this is a real ear-opener. Mompou&#8217;s like a warmer Debussy, an earthier Scriabin; Volodos brings fire when needed, but this is mostly music you can bathe in.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/top-23-of-2013-stephen-j-nereffid/part.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4346" alt="part" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/top-23-of-2013-stephen-j-nereffid/part.jpg" width="120" height="120" /></a>Pärt: Piano music<br />
Jeroen van Veen<br />
(Brilliant)</strong><br />
A valuable survey of a mostly underrecorded aspect of Pärt&#8217;s music, performed by a pianist who&#8217;s making quite a career from specialising in minimalism. The static beauty of “Für Alina”, which here gets four performances, is fairly typical but not the whole story.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/top-23-of-2013-stephen-j-nereffid/variations.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4354" alt="variations" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/top-23-of-2013-stephen-j-nereffid/variations.jpg" width="120" height="120" /></a>“Variations on a Theme by Scarlatti”<br />
Matan Porat<br />
(Mirare)</strong><br />
Among several mixed-repertoire piano recitals, this debut recording from Israeli composer-performer Porat stood out. A little motif heard in a Scarlatti sonata is the starting point for a journey that ranges from Couperin to Grieg to Boulez. Ingenious.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/top-23-of-2013-stephen-j-nereffid/roth.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4347" alt="roth" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/top-23-of-2013-stephen-j-nereffid/roth.jpg" width="120" height="120" /></a>Roth: Sometime I Sing<br />
Mark Padmore, Morgan Szymanski<br />
(Signum)</strong><br />
The English tenor and Mexican guitarist&#8217;s previous recording of the lyrical songs of Alec Roth is one of my favourites, and this one matches it. The settings here are mainly of texts by Vikram Seth and Tudor poet Thomas Wyatt.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/top-23-of-2013-stephen-j-nereffid/norgard.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4345" alt="norgard" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/top-23-of-2013-stephen-j-nereffid/norgard.jpg" width="120" height="120" /></a>Nørgård: Songs from Evening Land<br />
Helene Gjerris<br />
(Dacapo)</strong><br />
I still haven&#8217;t quite worked out why it is that I find Per Nørgård&#8217;s music so appealing; perhaps it&#8217;s what Tom Service described as “its simultaneous sense of freedom and coherence”. This collection covers music ranging from the 1950s to the present, including a show-stopping setting of Allen Ginsberg&#8217;s “Plutonian Ode”.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/top-23-of-2013-stephen-j-nereffid/mythos.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4344" alt="mythos" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/top-23-of-2013-stephen-j-nereffid/mythos.jpg" width="120" height="120" /></a>Stravinsky, Borodin, Tchaikovsky, Mussorgsky<br />
Mythos<br />
(Orchid)</strong><br />
And finally. This is too good to simply call a novelty release, but in fairness how many of us have listened to Stravinsky&#8217;s <em>Petrushka</em> and thought “oh, if only I could hear it played by an accordion duo”? Well, it turns out this is what we should have been thinking all along.</p>
<p>One other bit of business is to mention my favourite track not found on any of the above albums. “Piers Lane Goes To Town” (Hyperion) is another fine piano recital, this one of encore pieces, my highlight being Lane&#8217;s rendition of Dudley Moore&#8217;s unstoppable Beethoven parody, “And the same to you”.</p>
<p>All that&#8217;s left is for me to indulge in what seems to have become an annual ritual among many classical fans: the satisfied announcement that the supposed death of the classical recording industry has most unequivocally been postponed for another twelve months&#8230;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Any list implies criteria, but let&#8217;s eliminate some obvious candidates. This is not a list of the most original, or significant, or skilled, or successful releases of 2013. There is so much that I simply did not listen to that those kinds of judgments are out of reach (for me as for everyone else). Instead, I asked myself: if I were to be separated from my music for a month or two and could only keep 20 albums from my collection with me, all released in 2013, which would I choose? This approach keeps me from adding or skipping things because I somehow feel I ought to. Worthy or not in the ears of the world, this is what I liked most from this year&#8217;s releases. Listen in; who knows, you might like it too.<span id="more-4257"></span></p>

<strong>#1. Nils Frahm – <em>Spaces</em></strong><br />
Any time Nils Frahm releases music I pay attention these days. This year&#8217;s <em>Music for Wobbling</em> wasn&#8217;t my favorite, but in this newest collection, the epic extended version of <em>More</em> (already one of my favorite pieces of music) would alone justify the price of admission &#8211; watch the remarkable <a title="Frahm video" href="http://vimeo.com/78130481">video</a> and see for yourself. After the fragile intimacy of <em>Screws</em>, Spaces puts the range of Frahm’s talent on display in a live setting and makes me long to have been there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">.</span><br />
<img class="alignleft  wp-image-4265" alt="Den Sorte" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Den-Sorte-150x150.jpg" width="120" height="120" srcset="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Den-Sorte-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Den-Sorte.jpg 260w" sizes="(max-width: 120px) 100vw, 120px" /><strong>#2. Den Sorte Skole – <em>Lektion III</em></strong><br />
Quite an amazing achievement, this <a title="Den Sorte Skole" href="http://densorteskole.net/lektion-3/" target="_blank" class="broken_link">free (!!)</a> release is painstakingly and brilliantly constructed from samples taken from hundreds of old vinyl records. Much more than than simply a collage, the result is compelling music in its own right. The 90-minute album offers infectious rhythms, a range of musical styles, and fascinating vocal surprises, adding up to an epic adventure full of delightful twists and turns.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="alignleft  wp-image-4282" alt="Wandermude" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Wandermude-150x150.jpg" width="120" height="120" srcset="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Wandermude-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Wandermude.jpg 280w" sizes="(max-width: 120px) 100vw, 120px" /><strong>#3. Stephan Mathieu &amp; David Sylvian – <em>Wandermüde</em></strong><br />
Selling this as a David Sylvian release confused some listeners, judging by customer reviews; it’s really a Mathieu record. Sylvian’s music is taken as source material and transformed into rich, resonant drones and fragments of melody. The results are deeply absorbing, making this one of Mathieu’s most engaging outings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="alignleft  wp-image-4266" alt="Dysnomia" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Dysnomia-150x150.jpg" width="120" height="120" srcset="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Dysnomia-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Dysnomia.jpg 280w" sizes="(max-width: 120px) 100vw, 120px" /><strong>#4. Dawn of Midi – <em>Dysnomia</em></strong><br />
Built primarily upon gradually shifting rhythmic patterns, this unusual album (think roughly a jazz trio playing Eastern-tinged acoustic techno) works best listened to at one sitting. Slowly but surely it draws me deep into its rhythmic world until sitting still is virtually impossible. A stunning piece of work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>#5. Charles Lloyd – <em>Hagar&#8217;s Song<img class="alignleft  wp-image-4269" alt="Hagar's song" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Hagars-song-150x150.jpg" width="120" height="120" srcset="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Hagars-song-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Hagars-song.jpg 280w" sizes="(max-width: 120px) 100vw, 120px" /></em></strong><br />
Much of the jazz I bought and loved this year was not released in 2013, but <em>Hagar’s Song</em> is an outstanding recording. It marries Lloyd’s distinctive saxophone to Jason Moran’s excellent piano playing. The results are restrained and deep, at once stripped bare and full of presence.  A very varied set, finely recorded and beautifully played.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft  wp-image-4273" alt="Lighthouse" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Lighthouse-150x150.jpg" width="120" height="120" srcset="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Lighthouse-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Lighthouse.jpg 280w" sizes="(max-width: 120px) 100vw, 120px" />#6. Amiina – <em>The Lighthouse Project</em></strong><br />
Recorded during a series of shows performed in Icelandic lighthouses, this is simply a delightful record. Gently plaintive and always beautiful melodies carried by strings, chimes, and a deliciously warbling saw caress the air with musical grace.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">.</span><br />
<img class="alignleft  wp-image-4271" alt="Illuha" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Illuha-150x150.jpg" width="120" height="120" srcset="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Illuha-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Illuha.jpg 280w" sizes="(max-width: 120px) 100vw, 120px" /><strong>#7. Illuha – <em>Interstices</em></strong><br />
Drawing from and walking very closely in the steps of their remarkable and very distinctive debut <em>Shizuku</em>, Illuha offer a live take on their world of small glistering noises and resonances that together give a paradoxically active musical form to sheer peacefulness.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft  wp-image-4263" alt="Chatma" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Chatma-150x150.jpg" width="120" height="120" srcset="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Chatma-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Chatma.jpg 280w" sizes="(max-width: 120px) 100vw, 120px" />#8. Tamikrest – <em>Chatma</em></strong><br />
Like their fellow Tuareg musicians Tinariwen, Tamikrest make a sinuous, bluesy, desert rock music that gradually worms its way under the skin and defies the body to keep still. Alternately driving and pensive, <em>Chatma</em> is an invigorating and life-affirming album.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft  wp-image-4281" alt="Waking Life" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Waking-Life-150x150.jpg" width="120" height="120" srcset="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Waking-Life-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Waking-Life.jpg 280w" sizes="(max-width: 120px) 100vw, 120px" />#9. Andere – <em>Waking Life</em></strong><br />
Two rich, long, cloudy ambient/drone pieces, lightly graced with found sounds, unfold slowly and majestically. It’s a pity this collaboration between Anduin and Radere was not more widely noticed (the more so as proceeds went to charity) – it greatly rewards close listening.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft  wp-image-4274" alt="Liverdelphia" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Liverdelphia-150x150.jpg" width="120" height="120" srcset="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Liverdelphia-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Liverdelphia.jpg 280w" sizes="(max-width: 120px) 100vw, 120px" />#10. Ian Boddy – <em>Liverdelphia</em></strong><br />
Adding to his already considerable output of analog synth sequencing and cosmic swirls, Ian Boddy this year offered up an album that melds recordings from two concerts. This one is gently propulsive, very melodic, and altogether inviting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft  wp-image-4259" alt="Antonymes" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Antonymes-150x150.jpg" width="120" height="120" srcset="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Antonymes-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Antonymes.jpg 280w" sizes="(max-width: 120px) 100vw, 120px" />#11. Antonymes – <em>There Can Be No True Beauty Without Decay</em></strong><br />
Notable for being the fiftieth release from the excellent <em>Hibernate</em> label (be sure to check out their wonderful <a title="We Like Ambient" href="http://hibernaterecordings.bandcamp.com/album/we-like-ambient-curated-by-isnaj-dui" target="_blank" class="broken_link">five-volume sampler</a>, <em>We Like Ambient</em>, released to mark the milestone), this album extends earlier material by Antonymes and offers reworkings by related artists. It further demonstrates his mastery of quietly evocative, piano-led ambient music, with a darker edge here and there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft  wp-image-4261" alt="Blind Theatre" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Blind-Theatre-150x150.jpg" width="120" height="120" srcset="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Blind-Theatre-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Blind-Theatre.jpg 280w" sizes="(max-width: 120px) 100vw, 120px" />#12. Sam Thomas – <em>Blind Theatre</em></strong><br />
This feels less like a collection of songs than like a picaresque journey through a mercurial array of moods and guitar styles that refuses to settle in any one place for very long. By turns playful, aggressive, triumphant, pensive, and exhilarating, this is an album full of joyful surprises that should appeal to fans of early Mike Oldfield.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft  wp-image-4278" alt="Severence" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Severence-150x150.jpg" width="120" height="120" />#13. Severence &#8211; <em>Hidden Ceilings</em></strong><br />
Severence takes gaseous dub techno along the lines of earlier releases by Deadbeat or Pole, and stretches it out even further into the ether. Rhythms are often present mainly as a pulsing implication, while the spacious rush of echoes chasing one another airily around the soundscape is foregrounded. This finely detailed release is definitely one for headphones.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft  wp-image-4297" alt="Winter's Fire" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/top-20-of-2013-david-smith/Winters-Fire-150x150.jpg" width="120" height="120" srcset="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/top-20-of-2013-david-smith/Winters-Fire-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/top-20-of-2013-david-smith/Winters-Fire-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/top-20-of-2013-david-smith/Winters-Fire.jpg 350w" sizes="(max-width: 120px) 100vw, 120px" />#14. The Ashes of Piemonte – <em>Winter’s Fire</em></strong><br />
A lush ambient meditation on John Milton’s poem about an early modern massacre. Drifting tones and watery field recordings paint hazy pictures of a dim past in the colors of regret and remembrance. Read the full <em>Metelaifne Music</em> review <a title="Review: Winter’s Fire by The Ashes of Piemonte" href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//2013/08/review-winters-fire-by-the-ashes-of-piemonte/" target="_blank">here.</a> Check out also this duo&#8217;s second 2013 release, <a title="Datura Notes" href="http://theashesofpiemonte.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank">Datura Notes</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft  wp-image-4277" alt="Our small ideas" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Our-small-ideas-150x150.jpg" width="120" height="120" srcset="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Our-small-ideas-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Our-small-ideas.jpg 280w" sizes="(max-width: 120px) 100vw, 120px" />#15. The Boats &#8211; <em>Our Small Ideas</em></strong><br />
<em>Our Small Ideas</em> by The Boats is a much expanded reworking of a 200-copy CD release from 2008. This perfectly titled album charms with modest whimsy. If you are drawn by the thought of quaint and quavering sounds, mysterious music boxes found in antique stores, gentle, hesitant melodies that almost seem to ask permission to enter your listening space, and warm, soothing fragility (with the occasional subversive lyric), this is one worth spending time alone with.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>#16. Sav</strong><img class="alignleft  wp-image-4276" alt="Origin" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Origin-150x150.jpg" width="120" height="120" srcset="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Origin-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Origin.jpg 280w" sizes="(max-width: 120px) 100vw, 120px" /><strong>vas Ysatis &amp; Taylor Deupree &#8211; <em>Origin</em></strong><br />
Taylor Deupree’s <em>Faint</em>, appearing right at the end of 2012, has been one of my most-played albums since. To my ear this collaboration with Savvas Ysatis was the best of his multiple releases this year, somehow combining a deep, rich sound with a sense of austere precision and restraint.<br />
<strong> </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft  wp-image-4267" alt="emptywhale" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/emptywhale-150x150.jpg" width="120" height="120" srcset="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/emptywhale-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/emptywhale.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 120px) 100vw, 120px" />#17. Emptywhale – <em>Some Hollow Lullabies</em></strong><br />
An excellent <a title="Some Hollow Lullabies" href="https://archive.org/details/waag_rel025" target="_blank">free release</a>, this album explores territory quite similar to the Antonymes album mentioned above. Slowly shifting textures, gently evocative piano, and an atmosphere of thoughtful melancholy are skilfully woven together into a patient and beautiful whole.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft  wp-image-4262" alt="Brokeback" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Brokeback-150x150.jpg" width="120" height="120" srcset="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Brokeback-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Brokeback.jpg 280w" sizes="(max-width: 120px) 100vw, 120px" />#18. Brokeback – <em>Brokeback and the Black Rock</em></strong><br />
This took me a while to adjust to – it’s very different from earlier Brokeback releases from (can it be?) a decade ago. Once I could hear it in its own right, I discovered a personable and rather engaging collection of Western-tinged rock instrumentals with a pleasantly intimate feel. One to relax to.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft  wp-image-4270" alt="Haines" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Haines-150x150.jpg" width="120" height="120" srcset="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Haines-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Haines.jpg 280w" sizes="(max-width: 120px) 100vw, 120px" />#19. Greg Haines – <em>Where We Were</em></strong><br />
Haines turns his musical gaze from strings to synthesizers, delivering a fascinating recording that joins the elegant, classically tinged ambience of his previous work with stomping beats and cosmic atmospheres.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft  wp-image-4280" alt="tone-color" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/tone-color-150x150.jpg" width="120" height="120" srcset="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/tone-color-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/tone-color.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 120px) 100vw, 120px" /></strong></p>
<p><strong><strong>#20. </strong>Tone Color &#8211;  <em>The Last Day</em></strong></p>
<p>A largely unnoticed <a title="The Last Day" href="https://archive.org/details/ToneColor-TheLastDay" target="_blank">free release</a> on a small netlabel, this debut album broke little new ground, but charmed me with its warm hues, homely environmental sounds, and unassuming, gentle melodies. Comforting and very pleasurable, with some lovely, resonant moments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To any of these artists who happen to read this, a sincere thank you for sharing your gifts.</p>
