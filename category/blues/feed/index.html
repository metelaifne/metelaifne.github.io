				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Can it be a year since the last list? Here goes with my favorite 20 releases of 2017. Your tastes are not mine, you will disagree, but maybe there is something here that you might not have discovered, something of beauty that might bring you joy. At one point I thought this might be a thin year; when I got down to making the list I realized there was no filler at the bottom. Exact placement is fuzzy – there are lots of apples and oranges being compared here. Feel free to move any of these up or down a few places in your head.</p>
<p><a href="https://12kmusic.bandcamp.com/album/somi"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5412" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/top-20-of-2017-david-smith/Somi-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="200" srcset="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/top-20-of-2017-david-smith/Somi-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/top-20-of-2017-david-smith/Somi-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/top-20-of-2017-david-smith/Somi.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" /></a><strong>#1. Taylor Deupree – Somi</strong></p>
<p>Deupree’s <em>Faint</em> from a few years ago is still one of my regular listens and pleasures, and I wonder with hindsight if I should have placed it at number one that year. He gave me another chance with the magnificent, meditative <em>Somi</em>. Loops of single notes from acoustic instruments played at varying intervals are layered and treated to create a fascinating slow dance of beauty and rest. And the deluxe edition packaging was as gorgeous as the music. (<a href="https://12kmusic.bandcamp.com/album/somi">Listen</a>)</p>

<p><strong>#2. Daniel Herskedal – The Roc</strong></p>
<p>Norwegian tubaist Herskedal’s new album adds an Arabic influence to his tuba-based jazz-folk explorations. The result is a unique, at times magical set of tunes high in atmosphere and richly colored. Several parts of this album stayed in my head all year. (<a href="https://danielherskedal.bandcamp.com/album/the-roc">Listen</a>)</p>

<p><strong>#3. Pausal – Avifaunal</strong></p>
<p>Pausal’s warm and finely textured drones have been growing on me the last few years. This year’s release took things up a notch, with a sweeping grandeur and narrative flow that make each minute count. An album to get lost in. (<a href="https://dronarivm.bandcamp.com/album/avifaunal">Listen</a>)</p>

<p><a href="http://anzicstore.com/album/happy-song"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5417" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/top-20-of-2017-david-smith/Anat-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a></p>
<p><strong>#4. Anat Cohen Tentet – Happy Song</strong></p>
<p>The title and bright yellow cover are apt. New York-based Israeli clarinetist Cohen and her ensemble deliver a vibrantly grooving set of jazz romps that shift in character as the album progresses while maintaining an infectious sense of joy. (<a href="http://anzicstore.com/album/happy-song">Listen</a>)</p>

<p><strong>#5. Tinariwen – Elwan</strong></p>
<p>The Saharan blues return with the latest from the great Tuareg band, and it’s one of their finest. The sinuous, swaying rhythms undergird starkly poetic laments at the loss of social and environmental fabric.

<p><strong>#6. Seldom Sene Recorder Consort – Goldberg Variations</strong></p>
<p>As the title gives away, this is the Goldberg Variations played on recorders by a Dutch recorder consort. In addition to the virtuoso playing, the different sonorities of the wind instruments made the Goldbergs sparkle for me in a gentle and delightful new way. (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJQAgA44gCM">Listen</a>) (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdpwCWBuXpI">Listen</a>)</p>

<p><strong>#7. Otto A. Totland – The Lost</strong></p>
<p>Very similar in spirit to its predecessor, <em>Pinô</em>, this second album of piano solos again showcases Norwegian pianist Otto Totland’s ability to conjure a gentle, plaintive warmth through small melodies and soft sounds. (<a href="https://ottoatotland.bandcamp.com/">Listen</a>)</p>

<p><strong>#8. Chihei Hatakeyama &amp; Federico Durand – Sora</strong></p>
<p>Combining Hatakeyama’s characteristic gossamer tonal washes and Durand’s delightfully pattering small sounds is a recipe for enormous prettiness, and that is just what we get on this deeply calming album. (<a href="https://chiheihatakeyama.bandcamp.com/album/sora">Listen</a>)</p>

<p><strong>#9. The Green Kingdom – The North Wind and the Sun</strong></p>
<p>The Green Kingdom has issued a long series of recordings offering an attractive world of delicate small sounds and textures. This release feels like something fresh as it bursts forth into uplifting melody thanks to the foregrounded guitar work. (<a href="https://thegreenkingdom.bandcamp.com/album/the-north-wind-and-the-sun">Listen/Watch</a>)</p>

<p><strong>#10. Emile Parisien, Vincent Peirani, Andreas Schaerer &amp; Michael Wollny – Out of Land</strong></p>
<p>An unusual but top-notch European jazz combo consisting of sax, accordion, piano, and vocalizations/beatboxing. The live recordings prickle with energy and abound in creativity, making for an exciting listen. (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAKio4qfeqM">Watch</a>)</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://homeassemblymusic.bandcamp.com/album/weve-all-been-swimming"><img class="alignleft wp-image-5421 size-thumbnail" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/top-20-of-2017-david-smith/Fieldhead-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/top-20-of-2017-david-smith/Fieldhead-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/top-20-of-2017-david-smith/Fieldhead-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/top-20-of-2017-david-smith/Fieldhead-768x768.jpg 768w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/top-20-of-2017-david-smith/Fieldhead-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/top-20-of-2017-david-smith/Fieldhead.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a></strong></p>
<p><strong>#11. Fieldhead – We’ve All Been Swimming</strong></p>
<p>Fieldhead’s latest is by far my favorite by the artist so far. It plays with odd rhythmic combinations, layering looping synth melodies over divergent rhythms. The result is a kind of mellow fascination, and great fun. (<a href="https://homeassemblymusic.bandcamp.com/album/weve-all-been-swimming">Listen</a>)</p>

<p><strong>#12. Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark – The Punishment of Luxury</strong></p>
<p>Not much pop makes my lists, but I loved OMD as a teen, and this new release sounds as if it could have been the immediate follow up to 1983’s <em>Dazzle Ships</em>. It nails what made their original Kraftwerk-with-soul sound special, and that made me grin. (<a href="https://officialomd.bandcamp.com/releases">Listen</a>)</p>

<p><strong>#13. Rudresh Mahanthappa/Indo-Pak Coalition – Agrima </strong></p>

<p><strong>#14. Helge Lien Trio – Guzuguzu</strong></p>
<p>With track titles drawn from Japanese onomatopoeia, Helge Lien’s latest piano trio album is made up of moody evocations of atmosphere and movement, often skirting around song structures.

<p><strong>#15. Porya Hatami – Monads</strong></p>
<p>When I posted my review of this to Facebook none of my friends hit “like,” and it is admittedly a pretty abstract set of experiments with sound rather than a collection of tunes. But they are fascinating experiments, glimpses into the push-and-pull of forces that make the world a place with sound.

<p><strong>#17. Alea Saxophone Quartet – Arvo Pärt: Anima</strong></p>
<p>If the idea of Pärt played on saxophones conjures up a mental collision of ethereal voices and ill-chosen skronking, think again. The pure tones and harmonies of the sax quartet evocatively capture the spirit of Pärt’s austere choral pieces.

<p><strong>#18. Taylor Deupree &amp; Marcus Fischer – Lowlands</strong></p>
<p>Building on previous outings as a duo, Deupree and Fischer again show a mastery of the microscopic world of small resonances, adding another delightful release to their growing oeuvre. (<a href="https://12kmusic.bandcamp.com/album/lowlands">Listen</a>)</p>

<p><strong>#19. Brot &amp; Sterne – Tales of Herbst</strong></p>
<p>This was not quite like anything else I listened to, which is perhaps not surprising in the case of a hurdy-gurdy/hang drum/trumpet jazz trio. The improvised instrumentals set warmly tuneful passages amid unique and atmospheric textures. (<a href="https://brotundsterne.bandcamp.com/releases">Listen</a>)</p>

<p><strong>#20. Billow Observatory – II: Plains/Patterns </strong></p>

<p><strong>The next 10&#8230;</strong></p>
<p>And here are ten more that I had a really hard time cutting to get the list down to 20. Some of these jumped in and out of my list several times, and might have made it if I had finalized the list tomorrow. Alphabetically:</p>
<p>Wil Bolton – Night Paths (Ambient)</p>
<p>Bruce Cockburn – Bone on Bone (Folk)</p>
<p>Marcus Fischer – Loss (Ambient)</p>
<p>From the Mouth of the Sun – Hymn Binding (Modern Classical)</p>

<p>Hudson – Hudson (Jazz)</p>
<p>Rafael Anton Irisarri – The Shameless Years (Ambient)</p>
<p>Benedikt Jahnel Trio – The Invariant (Piano jazz)</p>
<p>Darren McClure – Nature Mirror (Ambient)</p>
<p>Phronesis, Julian Argüelles, &amp; Frankfurt Radio Big Band – The Behemoth (Jazz)</p>
<p>As ever, if any of the artists happen by, thank you for another year of inspiring music.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8216;Best of&#8217; year-end lists are very subjective, being subject to the individual musical tastes of the compiler and my list, of course, is no different.  Thus, the albums I have named (in no particular order) are simply the newly released ones that I enjoyed listening to the most during 2014.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71fdesic4OL._SY450_.jpg" alt="" width="241" height="241" /></p>
<p><strong><em>Love and Gravity</em> &#8211; Mary Fahl</strong>:  This newest album by Mary Fahl recalls the glory days of her now defunct group October Project and excels them.  Fahl&#8217;s rich contralto voice sounds as good as ever with no fillers here. Each track is a treasure, but a few standouts warrant special mention.  It is hard to imagine a siren more spellbinding than in the song, &#8220;Siren,&#8221; and Fahl&#8217;s cover of &#8220;Both Sides Now&#8221; sounds like the song was written especially for her, infusing it with a deep emotional introspection I never appreciated before (not to take away from Collins’ timeless original). Then there is the beautiful memorial, &#8220;The Dawning of the Day,&#8221; written for the fallen firefighter heroes of 9/11. This is a stunning album from start to finish.<span id="more-4821"></span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://f1.bcbits.com/img/a1710119280_2.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="250" /></p>
<p><strong><em>Amser </em>&#8211; Fernhill</strong>:  Some years back, reading Eliza Carthy’s unabashed gushing in praise of the new (to me) Welsh folk group, Fernhill, prompted me to listen to the 2000 release, <em>Whilia</em>, and it left me speechless. That album became the standard by which I measure all other Fernhill albums and <em>Amser</em> measures up pretty well.  <em>Whilia&#8217;s</em> lineup consisted of lead singer Julie Murphy accompanied by Ceri Rhys Matthews on guitar and flute, and Andy Cutting&#8217;s prominent (and vital) button accordion.  <em>Amser</em> includes Tomos Williams on trumpet and Christine Cooper on fiddle and vocals.  I found this newest release so gorgeous, I was surprised that it was only after I listened to the whole album that I noticed the absence of the button accordion which I considered essential to the band&#8217;s sound. No matter. This is truly stunning music, segueing from one beautiful melody into another, and another, and then back again that leaves the listener breathless. The song, &#8220;Boat,&#8221; is a particularly good example of this.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/91C7KM%2B6CLL._SX425_.jpg" alt="" width="243" height="243" /></p>
<p><strong><em>Angelorum </em>&#8211; James Apollo</strong>:  This one grabbed me right from the start and kept my attention throughout.  Apparently I&#8217;m not alone. Apollo is steadily gaining attention, having been invited to tour with Lord Huron since <em>Angelorum&#8217;s</em> release.  The album&#8217;s 9 tracks are a mixture of indie rock songs and slower tempo ones and there really isn&#8217;t a dud anywhere and it is a heckuva <em>good</em> indie rock album. Give the track, &#8220;Spinnin&#8221; or &#8220;White Line&#8221; a listen and see for yourself. It has been reported that Leon Russell is currently working with Apollo on a yet untitled 2015 release, and I&#8217;m definitely going to be watching for that!</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/81uOONm%2BEQL._SX425_.jpg" alt="" width="246" height="217" /></p>
<p><em><strong>Last of the Outlaws</strong></em><strong> &#8211; Railroad Earth</strong>:  Railroad Earth is a rootsy Americana newgrass band with folk/roots-rock/celtic leanings who have consistently put out great records since releasing their debut in 2001. Live shows have earned them a reputation as champion of the bluegrass jam for their spontaneous improvisations which have, for the most part, been absent in their studio recordings. <em>Last of the Outlaws</em> changes that. With only 2 of the 10 tracks less than 5 minutes in length, the new album provides plenty of wide open spaces  for the band to romp around and sounds very close to their live performances.  The core and highlight of the album are two back-to-back lengthy songs that together form a 20+ minute opus with segueing sections patterned after movements of the requiem mass that shift from rock guitar licks to whispering piano and everything in between, including horns, string section, and penny whistle.  A true masterpiece.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/81pBJPXP5XL._SY450_.jpg" alt="" width="247" height="247" /></p>
<p><em><strong>A Little Redemption</strong></em><strong> &#8211; Danni Nicholls</strong>:  This album made its debut in the U.K. in 2013 but wasn&#8217;t released in the U.S. until 2014.  Q Magazine describes it as &#8220;slipping effortlessly between smoky soul, folk-pop and heart-wrenching alt-country, all in a rich voice somewhere between Ms [Emmylou] Harris and Alison Krauss.&#8221;  I found Nicholls&#8217; voice somewhat reminiscent of Norah Jones, but whether Jones, Harris or Krauss, Nicholls carves her own niche and is no wannabe.  The opening track, &#8220;First Cuckoo of Spring,&#8221; is one of the many highlights and was featured in the latest season premier episode of Sons of Anarchy, which should give her more very well-deserved U.S. exposure. I look forward to hearing more from her in the future.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/81uw0f3MNwL._SX522_.jpg" alt="" width="264" height="264" /></p>
<p><strong><em>Family</em> &#8211; Thompson</strong>:  The opening track begins with a plaintive Teddy Thompson singing a simple song about family:  &#8220;My father is one of the greatest to ever step on a stage/My mother has the most beautiful voice in the world/And I am betwixt and between/Sean Lennon, you know what I mean/Born to the manor, never quite clamoring free/But it’s family…it’s family.&#8221;  And what a family it is!  Teddy managed to get his estranged parents, legends Richard and Linda Thompson, together (along with a few other extended family members) to help out with his new recording project and the results are impressive. This is not a polished album and it lacks cohesiveness, but the sum of the individual parts makes for such an endearing listen that I found myself coming back to play this one over and over again during the past year.  A most bittersweet, unforgettable and touching recording.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51-Uo-VtEhL.jpg" alt="" width="257" height="257" /></p>
<p><em><strong>Arc Iris</strong></em><strong> &#8211; Arc Iri</strong>s:  &#8220;Arc Iris is the orchestral pop project of Jocie Adams, a former core member of The Low Anthem…The band includes a collective of 4 musicians plus Jocie with additional players frequently joining to expand the sound further to create their wild exploration of all kinds of musical styles &#8211; jazz, prog rock, blues, country, folk, and classical styles.&#8221; So says Amazon&#8217;s editorial review which prompted me to give this album a listen.  Its style is not dissimilar to some of Kate Bush&#8217;s albums.  I found it &#8220;unusual&#8221; and not particularly to my liking at first and intended to quit listening but it soon got its hooks in me and I ended up playing the entire album. What kept me listening were the constant little surprises that keep popping up everywhere (a byproduct of that &#8220;wild exploration&#8221; the Amazon review talked about).  It is completely unconventional and works incredibly well.  By album’s end, I had to admit this is a brilliant recording.  Wonderfully, refreshingly different.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51CBccbFzTL._SS280.jpg" alt="" width="251" height="251" /></p>
<p><strong><em>Still on the Levee</em> &#8211; Chris Smither</strong>:  This is a 2 CD set released to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Smither&#8217;s career and includes newly recorded versions of 25 of his best songs.  Guest musicians include Allen Toussaint, Loudon Wainwright, Kris Delmhorst, and the band Morphine.  I loved this album immediately and it just seems to get better every time I play it.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/91I-fooUcuL._SL1400_.jpg" alt="" width="249" height="249" /></p>
<p><em><strong>So It Is With Us</strong></em><strong> &#8211; Horse Feathers</strong>:  One of the best folk rock albums I&#8217;ve heard in a long while.  I was previously unfamiliar with Horse Feathers, but apparently their previous albums evoke a more pessimistic and sad feeling.  I found the new release generally sounds upbeat.  Apparently it is the group&#8217;s first album that includes percussion, a change that was made at the very brink of bandleader Justin Ringle&#8217;s decision to hang it all up.  The whole album is one big dreamy mellow jam.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61p5r%2BaXNpL._SS280.jpg" alt="" width="252" height="252" /></p>
<p><strong><em>Tracks</em> &#8211; Anne Hills</strong>:  This is an album built around the theme of trains.  I love folk singer, Anne Hills, but an album where every single song is about a train dampened my enthusiasm a little at first, but this is truly one of the outstanding albums of the year. The whole album moves in a very appealing rhythm reminiscent of a rolling train.  I was afraid all the songs would sound alike, but there is much variety including both original compositions and old folk standards. Among the many highlights are a cover of &#8220;City of New Orleans,&#8221; the very humorous &#8220;Train to Morrow&#8221; (which made me laugh out loud), and the gorgeous &#8220;Pullman Porter&#8217;s Christmas.&#8221; Anne says on her website, &#8221; I’m riding the rails that go back in history but also carry me forward … climb on board.” Good advice.  I&#8217;m glad I did.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51H2YHCKG1L._SS280.jpg" alt="" width="259" height="259" /></p>
<p><em><strong>Nothing Can Bring Back the Time</strong></em><strong> &#8211; Josienne Clarke &amp; Ben Walker</strong>:  Tastefully elegant symphonic arrangements are prominent on this beautiful new release. Clarke and Walker continue to wow us with their talents on multiple instruments and Clarke’s heart-skipping lilting voice is, as always, a real show-stopper.  There is a unique version of &#8220;Let No Man Steal Your Thyme&#8221; here which is the best I’ve heard, and the closing &#8220;Water and Wine&#8221; &#8211; a slow, moving song quietly punctuated with piano and sweeping symphonics &#8211;  brings this classy, refined album to a very satisfying close.  Chamber folk doesn’t get any better than this.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71o-G5MPJPL._SX425_.jpg" alt="" width="267" height="246" /></p>
<p><em><strong>Lullaby and&#8230;the Ceaseless Roar</strong></em><strong> &#8211; Robert Plant</strong>:  Plant is back home from America but the musical influences of his days with Krauss and Griffin are still evident even as he continues to push the envelope a little further into new territories.  In this writer’s opinion, this is one of his best efforts yet.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/81E5ZWxfJrL._SX450_.jpg" alt="" width="254" height="228" /></p>
<p><em><strong>When the Deal Goes Down</strong></em> <strong>&#8211; David Olney</strong>:  I&#8217;ve been a die-hard Olney fan for years.  I just don&#8217;t understand how such a talented musician and showman can remain generally under the radar for all these years.  Mainstream has ignored him, although a whole lot of mainstream artists have covered his songs and made huge hits from them.  But if you really want the real deal, give Olney a listen.  I raved about Olney shamelessly in a <a title="David Olney’s Mini-Album Series: Art for the Ears" href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//2012/04/david-olneys-mini-album-series-art-for-the-ears/">previous</a> review, so I won&#8217;t re-hash it all here. Suffice it to say that <em>When the Deal Goes Down</em> is probably the best recording of Olney&#8217;s entire career.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61ELIEfj4AL.jpg" alt="" width="258" height="258" /></p>
<p><em><strong>Vena Portae</strong></em> <strong>– Vena Portae</strong>:  This is the debut album from a side project of Australian singer Emily Barker, who regularly performs with her full time band, The Red Clay Halo.  The side project is a threesome which she describes as a Swedish/Anglo/Aussie collaboration with Swedish producer-engineer-multi-instrumentalist Ruben Engzell, and English theatre maker-songwriter Dom Coyote. Jesper Jonsson, also from Sweden, appears on the record, as well. Emily’s work with The Red Clay Halo has a spark that consistently ignites all their recordings (2013’s <em>Dear River </em>made my desert island list), whereas the music of Vena Portae is necessarily a little more pared down and intimate sounding.  It is lovely, though, and Barker’s vocals are as impressive as ever.  This is a very, very fine debut album.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://cps-static.rovicorp.com/3/JPG_400/MI0003/782/MI0003782159.jpg?partner=allrovi.com" alt="" width="257" height="257" /></p>
<p><em><strong>Bela Fleck and Abigail Washburn</strong></em> <strong>&#8211; Bela Fleck and Abigail Washburn</strong>:  A full album of nothing but two people playing banjos and some vocals might raise some serious skepticism in many listeners, but those who take the plunge anyway will be surprised to find that this recording sounds like a whole lot more. This is achieved by the use of seven different kinds of banjos, ranging from small ukulele types to larger baritone banjos that help serve as a bass line.  Fleck and Washburn ingenuously bring in various influences including blues, African beats, old-time folk, and even an adaptation of a Béla Bartok classical composition.  The album is much more than what might be expected from such a limited lineup.  Very rewarding.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/91KMmQzslAL._SX425_.jpg" alt="" width="258" height="232" /></p>
<p><em><strong>Vagabond</strong> </em><strong>&#8211; Eddi Reader</strong>:  There are few singers with a more beautiful voice than Reader&#8217;s, and with John McCusker, Karen Matheson, Declan O’Rourke and Boo Hewerdine in the lineup, you know you’re in for a treat. There are no disappointments here. It is easily one of the most impressive recordings of the decade in my book.</p>

<p><em><strong>Resolution Road</strong></em> <strong>– Easton Stagger Phillips</strong>:  This album is from a collective made up of three musicians who each have successful musical careers as individuals – Tim Easton, Leeroy Stagger, and Evan Phillips.  It is a very catchy alt country/roots rock album with hooks a plenty and incredible harmonies.  This one demands repeat playing and is thoroughly enjoyable.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/91HN6lbc1nL._SX522_.jpg" alt="" width="257" height="257" /></p>
<p><em><strong>Dharma Blues</strong></em><strong> &#8211; Peter Rowan</strong>:  This has been getting rave reviews and no wonder. Peter Rowan has been a top-notch musician since his early days under the tutelage of the father of bluegrass himself, Bill Monroe, but Rowan is so much more than a bluegrass icon.  He is constantly evolving and <em>Dharma Blues</em> is one of the best albums of his career so far. Eastern influences are all stirred up with elements of rock, folk, blues, country, gospel, and bluegrass.  This is an album that should appeal to a large audience, not just bluegrass aficionados.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/512f9%2BaV4FL._SY450_.jpg" alt="" width="257" height="257" /></p>
<p><em><strong>Lost in the Dream</strong></em> <strong>&#8211; War on Drugs</strong>: It almost seems blasphemous to put this album towards the bottom of a &#8216;best-of&#8217; list since it holds the #1 spot of almost all the &#8216;best of 2014&#8217; lists of every indie/rock/folk related website out there, but (really) this list is in no particular order. I will admit I put off listening to this one for a long time.  I don&#8217;t know &#8211; maybe it&#8217;s the band name, but it just didn&#8217;t appeal to me.  All the hoop-la finally got my curiosity up, though.  And it really <em>is</em> that good.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/519ByHWawoL._SS280.jpg" alt="" width="267" height="267" /></p>
<p><em><strong>When the Day is on the Turn</strong></em> <strong>&#8211; Dallahan</strong>:  Here we have a rollicking blast from a new band just launched a year ago.  This is Dallahan&#8217;s debut album and it features original music as well as traditional Irish tunes and songs.  The majority of the tracks are instrumentals, with vocals on five of the 12 (counting the bonus track) that range from mournful laments to toe-tapping reels.  It is easy to see why they earned an Emerging Excellence Award from Help Musicians UK and were recently nominated for Best Up and Coming Artist of the Year at the Scots Trad Music Awards 2014.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I didn’t listen to everything this year. Neither did you. I have no objective way of knowing that these are (or are not) the 20 best albums released this year. Neither do you. But these are the ones I most loved and most want to spend more time with next year, and who knows, maybe you’ll find something special here too, something you missed but can connect with and find riches in, something off your usual menu that you might come to be thankful for. If that happens even once, the list will be worthwhile. And as always, if any of the musicians drop by, thank you for the work, care, commitment, and creativity represented below.<span id="more-4679"></span></p>

<strong>#1. Porya Hatami – Shallow</strong><br />
Iran’s Porya Hatami had an enormously productive year – at least eight releases by my count. This was the first and is still my favorite. Hatami takes field recordings, gentle drones, bright chiming flutters of notes, and builds them into an enchanting and unusually well composed ambient symphony that I have been listening to all year without tiring. The irregular patters of sound unfold within an overall structure that creates a sense of focus and development. Just beautiful, a true gift.

<strong>#2. Pjusk – Solstøv</strong><br />
I am an unabashed Pjusk fan, and this pushed <em>Shallow</em> close for the number one slot. Pjusk continue their distinctive weaving of dusk and landscape and luminous pulses and this time add processed trumpet to conjure breath and light in the airy transitions of morning and evening. Glimpse, faded, dawn, bewitching, veil, glow &#8211; the track titles suggest the elusive textures that the music seeks to evoke. Detailed and evocative, the newest Pjusk album is as finely wrought as their back catalog.

<strong>#3. Tord Gustavsen Quartet – Extended Circle</strong><br />
A second entry from Norway, this has been my most played jazz release of 2014. At the heart of it is Gustavsen’s distinctively languid piano playing, weaving innocuous seeming tunes with such a sensitive touch and timing that they float deliciously and linger tenderly in the subconscious.

<strong>#4. Rafael Anton Irisarri – The Unintentional Sea</strong><br />
In some ways the opposite of Christopher Bissonnette’s album in its aesthetic, The Unintentional Sea flows through hazy, grainy curtains of delicately layered sound. Deep trembling tones and hidden crackles and rustles hint at great themes unfolding and give way to melancholy swells of subdued melody. The whole is graceful and sensitive, perfect for times of quiet solitude and reflection.

<strong>#5. Christopher Bissonnette – Essays in Idleness</strong><br />
This one was a delightful surprise, a hugely rewarding departure from the sound of Bissonnette’s enjoyable previous releases. Here he takes a homemade synthesizer and weaves its bright, distinctive sounds into starkly expressive crystalline meditations. The sounds are cold and alien, yet strangely eloquent and human. One of the more distinctive releases of this year. Listen to music from <em>Essays in Idleness </em><a href="https://soundcloud.com/kranky/christopher-bissonnette">here</a>.</p>

<strong>#6. Otto A. Totland &#8211; Piño</strong><br />
Otto Totland&#8217;s reflective piano meditations are familiar to fans of Deaf Center, his recording duo with Erik Skodvin. Here we are treated to a whole album of gently brooding piano compositions, warm and still and human, perfect for a mellow late evening. The sound is intimate, and it is no surprise to find that Nils Frahm had a hand in the recording process. Listen to a track <a href="http://www.sonicpieces.com/sonicpieces019.html">here</a>.</p>

<strong>#7. Janek Schaefer &#8211; Lay-by Lullaby</strong><br />
The early hours of the morning, at the side of the road, drifting, half awake, snatches of static and random radio melodies, cars swishing by, a state between times and places, subtly captured in ghostly, caressing sounds. Deeply evocative. Listen to some tracks <a href="http://www.12k.com/index.php/site/releases/lay-by_lullaby/" class="broken_link">here</a>.</p>

<strong>#8. Loscil &#8211; Sea Island</strong><br />
A welcome return to the core loscil sound, this latest album weaves the characteristic gently hypnotic tones and rhythms around an evocation of the tensions surrounding an island, once home to a Native American tribe, that now houses Vancouver airport and a nature preserve. Beauty, melancholy and an underlying tension combine with the song titles into a thought-provoking implied narrative.

<strong>#9. Chick Corea Trio &#8211; Trilogy </strong><br />
Pianist Corea is joined by bassist Christian McBride and drummer Brian Blade for three CDs filled with scintillating live recordings made around the world. Simply three genuinely virtuoso musicians sounding as if they are enjoying themselves greatly while offering up almost four hours of captivating music.

<strong>#10. Tinariwen &#8211; Emmaar</strong><br />
The throaty vocals, snaking melody lines, and bluesy guitars are all in full force on this latest from the Tuareg maestros, but more than anything it&#8217;s the intricately insistent rhythms that grab me by the ears and make my poor Western body want to move in more than one direction at once. A compelling glimpse into another musical dialect, seasoned with just enough of the West to provide a bridge.

<strong>#11. Ian William Craig &#8211; A Turn of Breath</strong><br />
Billed as &#8220;twelve works for voice and 1/4″ tape&#8221;, the melodic beauty of a trained male tenor duets with a medium that encases it in loops and decays into distortion, creating a broken patchwork through which the vocal melody shines like shafts of sunlight through winter cloud.

<strong>#12. Pascal Savy &#8211; Adrift</strong><br />
This almost feels like a companion album to the Rafael Anton Irisarri release &#8211; ocean-themed, built on finely textured, mysteriously swirling mists of sound with hints of strings, evoking a softly swelling place, numinous, and without horizon. Ominous moments and hints of the chaotic power of the elements resolve ultimately in a quiet disappearance into the fog. Listen <a href="https://eileanrec.bandcamp.com/album/adrift">here</a>.</p>

<strong>#13. Illuha &#8211; Akari</strong><br />
A little more austere in places than their somewhat lusher previous work, this latest from duo Illuha continues their focus on rustling, glistening landscapes of tiny sounds, inviting the listener to slow, to linger, to notice little, fragile shards of light and welcome them in silence. It embodies pleasure in the discovery of small beauties. Listen to a track <a href="http://www.12k.com/index.php/site/releases/akari/">here</a>.</p>

<strong>#14. Thomas Köner &#8211; Tiento de las Nieves</strong><br />
A departure from Köner&#8217;s accustomed arctic wastes of sonic near-absence, this 68 minute piece recalls compositions such as Michael Nyman&#8217;s Decay Music that work by letting single piano gestures decay into stillness instead of sustaining motion by hurrying into one another. Köner adds a focus on bringing deep resonances to the fore, conjuring haunting extended tones from the slide into silence.

<strong>#15. Kate Carr &#8211; The Kakapo </strong><br />
I am cheating slightly with this one, letting it stand for a series reaching back into late 2012. Kate Carr commissioned 12 ambient works for 3&#8243; CD, each focused on a specific bird. Taking us beyond the well-trodden path of random birdsong used to adorn relaxation music, the series yielded an array of fascinating compositions each saying something about a specific feathered creature and our relationship to it. Carr&#8217;s meditation on the kakapo, an endangered flightless parrot, brought the visionary series to a satisfying close.

<strong>#16. Avishai Cohen &#8211; Dark Nights</strong><br />
This album by rising jazz trumpeter Cohen had me hooked from its plaintively bluesy, tensely brooding opening notes. The rest of the album soars and wanders through varying styles and moods, all conveying passion without bluster and an accessible yet rigorous honesty.

<strong>#17. René Margraff &#8211; Phasen</strong><br />
The album&#8217;s title suggests states of being rather than stories, and indeed each track by René Margraff focuses more on a particular texture than on constructing movement. As I listen to each hazily droning modulation of noise I find myself thinking of it as the atmosphere of a room in an abandoned building, each with its own space and debris and pattern of dusty sunlight and dim atmosphere.

<strong>#18. Peter Rosendal &#8211; Love for Snail</strong><br />
The title and cover offer clues to the sheer quirky difference of this album, which seems determined to figure out how many diverse ways it can make a catchy tune without losing its sense of offbeat surprise at the fresh sounds that music can make. It&#8217;s jazz of an idiosyncratic, impish bent, and it makes me smile. I couldn&#8217;t find a public stream, but it&#8217;s on the major music services.</p>

<strong>#19. Marcin Wasilewski Trio with Joakim Milder &#8211; Spark of Life</strong><br />
I have been a fan for a while of this trio&#8217;s music and of Wasilewski&#8217;s approach to the piano. This latest release slides more easily into the background than earlier efforts, but contains plenty of beauty when given full attention. I never would have believed that a jazz piano trio treatment of The Police&#8217;s <em>Message in a Bottle</em> would ever be my favorite track on an album&#8230; Listen <a href="http://player.ecmrecords.com/spark-of-life">here</a>.</p>

<strong>#20. Lawrence English &#8211; Wilderness of Mirrors</strong><br />
Exploring sonic territory similar to some of Tim Hecker’s work, English offers here a series of exercises in controlled fury, a measured gusting of swirling noise punctuated with the ominous hum of absence. Finely crafted, dramatic, at some points even awe-inspiring. Listen<a href="https://soundcloud.com/room40/the-liquid-casket?in=room40/sets/lawrence-english-wilderness"> here</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>“I have no doubt that in a very short time John Fullbright will be a household name in American music.” </em>– Jimmy Webb</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>&#8220;[At SXSW], this young Oklahoman&#8217;s name was on everybody&#8217;s lips.&#8221;</em> &#8211; American Songwriter</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a graveyard on the north side of the small rural town of Okemah, Oklahoma, where 23-year-old John Fullbright was raised (and still resides) are two tombstones marking the graves of two very different men.  One is on the east side of the cemetery; the other on the west. In between the two is where Fullbright says he&#8217;d like his own tombstone to be placed. Why? Because the two tombstones bear the names of the two most influential people in his life &#8211; his grandpa  and Woody Guthrie.  It is the subject of a song Fullbright wrote called &#8220;Tombstone,&#8221; one of the standout tracks on a live recording of a concert he performed three years ago at the <a href="http://www.bluedoorokc.com/blue-door-history/">Blue Door</a> in Oklahoma City bearing the simple title of <em>Live at the Blue Door. </em> It was not promoted nationally, but it was an attention-getter for those who heard it (it set sales records at the 2009 Woodyfest, the annual folk festival honoring Woody Guthrie), and Fullbright has continued to promote the album through a heavy touring schedule with his shows steadily gaining him a growing fan base one gig at a time.</p>
<p>The recording project was simple &#8211; a one-man show with just a voice, a guitar, and a harmonica, but lest you are thinking (like I was) that this by definition spells &#8216;boring&#8217;,  think again.   I was surprised at the depth and fullness that is generated by this one-man band and captured in the live recording.  Thirteen of its 17 tracks are Fullbright&#8217;s own compositions, and he writes surprisingly insightful and mature lyrics that belie his youth (he was a mere 21  years old then, but had already become a favorite at outdoor music festivals before he was out of high school).  He is able to create quite a sound all by himself, slapping the guitar strings with such fervor that the lack of a drumset is not even noticed, and gives a unique vocal delivery that makes the listener stand up and take notice.<span id="more-2971"></span></p>
<p><em>Live at the Blue Door</em> was recorded and distributed in 2009 by a local label, Blue Door Records, with the aid of The Blue Door&#8217;s owner, Greg Johnson, who was so taken by Fullbright&#8217;s talent that he became his manager to help get his career off the ground.  Johnson, a native of Oklahoma City, had been involved with the singer/songwriter community in Austin as a music journalist, publicist and host of Woody Guthrie concerts for nearly a decade before returning to OKC and acquiring The Blue Door and convincing many of his Austin friends to perform there.  Since then, The Blue Door has become Oklahoma&#8217;s premiere venue for performing songwriters and has hosted such legends as Jimmy Webb, Joe Ely, Ramblin’ Jack Elliott, and many others.</p>
<p>John Fullbright seems destined to become a legend himself, and his time may have finally arrived with the release on May 8, 2012, of his debut studio recording, <em>From the </em><em>Ground Up.</em>  The new CD was funded entirely by fans through <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/71040261/from-the-ground-up-1">Kickstarter</a>, and is being released on Fullbright&#8217;s own independent label, Blue Dirt Records, with the distributor, Thirty Tigers, acting as label staff.   This time around, though, Fullbright is backed by a full band, including Terry &#8220;Buffalo&#8221; Ware, Andrew Hardin, and Ryan Engleman (guitar), Fats Kaplin (violin and steel guitar) Jess Klein (backup vocals), John Knudson (organ), Wes Sharon (bass), and Giovanni Carnuccio III (drums).  Fullbright plays the piano and harmonica parts, almost all of the organ parts and much of the guitar work, and co-produced the album with Wes Sharon, the  owner of 115 Studios in Norman, Oklahoma.</p>
<p>The CD release show is scheduled for May 3-4, 2012 at The Blue Door in Oklahoma City, and Fullbright will launch his first national tour with shows in Los Angeles on May 10 and in New York City on May 17.  The full tour schedule can be seen <a href="http://www.johnfullbrightmusic.com/tour/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Here’s the first music video of the track &#8220;Satan &amp; St. Paul,&#8221; from the new CD:</p>
<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/TPXfwgKd208?rel=0" frameborder="0" width="560" height="315"></iframe></p>
<p>Also, the new album&#8217;s first single, &#8220;Gawd Above,&#8221; was recently released through Paste Magazine, which you can stream <a href="http://www.pastemagazine.com/blogs/av/2012/04/song-premiere-john-fullbright-gawd-above.html">here</a>.  I have wondered just what Fullbright could do with a full band behind him ever since I heard what he is capable of solo on <em>Live at the Blue Door</em>, and if these previews are any indication of how good the rest of the album sounds, it should catch fire like crazy and burn the whole house down.</p>
<p>Four of the tracks on the new album are fleshed out fuller versions of songs that were recorded solo on  <em>Live at the Blue Door</em> &#8211; &#8220;Moving On,&#8221; &#8220;Jericho,&#8221; &#8220;All the Time in the World,&#8221; and &#8220;Satan &amp; St. Paul&#8221;  &#8211; all outstanding songs, but I won&#8217;t be throwing out <em>Live at the Blue Door</em>.  There&#8217;s too many killer songs on it that you won&#8217;t hear anywhere else, like &#8220;Tombstone,&#8221; &#8220;Blameless,&#8221; &#8220;Unlocked Doors,&#8221; &#8220;New Arrival,&#8221; and  more, including a stunning cover of Leonard Cohen&#8217;s &#8220;Hallelujah,&#8221; in which Fullbright puts all questions to rest as to whether we really need yet one more version of this song.</p>
<p>Three years ago a seed was planted at The Blue Door in Oklahoma City with the recording of that simple solo performance.  Fullbright performed it the night before he left for Memphis to attend the Folk Alliance, his very first big music industry convention.  He took some burned CDs of the concert with him to Memphis, hoping to stir up some interest.  Since then, the seed has had time to sprout &#8220;from the ground up&#8221; and now, with the release of the new studio album, it is beginning to branch out far and wide.  It&#8217;s about time.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><em>&#8220;To me, it&#8217;s bogus that art can only be in museums.  The real art is what goes on when people don&#8217;t expect it.  My idea of a good time is getting in front of an audience and giving them more than they expected.  That makes it a worthwhile, fulfilling thing to me.&#8221;</em> &#8211; David Olney</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Townes Van Zandt&#8217;s short list of favorite music writers included Mozart, Lightnin&#8217; Hopkins, Bob Dylan, and &#8230; his buddy, David Olney.  Obviously Olney keeps pretty good company, and deservedly so (except Eric Taylor once said, &#8220;Townes must have had a drink or two when he said Olney was up there with Mozart &#8211; Olney&#8217;s about as good as it gets when it comes to writin&#8217;, but he don&#8217;t sing like Mozart.&#8221;).  With a career spanning more than four decades, he&#8217;s had time to polish his art to a fine shine.  Whether performing blues, jazz, country, or folk ballads, Olney excels in them all &#8211; not to mention he can seriously rock.   In short, David Olney is one brilliant artist &#8211; even if he doesn&#8217;t sing like Mozart.   I am constantly amazed at what he comes up with next.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">His latest venture is a unique series of thematic mini-album EPs on his own Deadbeet Records label, two of which have been released so far.  Each EP consists of reinterpretations of some of Olney&#8217;s classic catalog tunes combined with brand new songs to create its own unique theme.  The series capitalizes on Olney&#8217;s special talent for spinning a tale, which has made him one of the most original and impressive storytellers in the music business.</p>
<p><img id="prodImage" class="aligncenter" style="border: 0px;" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61XcsSPJSqL._SL500_AA300_.jpg" alt="The Stone" width="300" height="300" border="0" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>&#8220;Something happened. Back there all those centuries ago. Something not easily believed or easily dismissed. Two thousand years of glory and horror, of love and hate, of beauty and violence have only made those long ago events more murky and more enigmatic. But nothing comes of nothing. Something happened. The Stone is an attempt to address those events. From varying points of view (a con man, a donkey, a murderer and a soldier), a story is told. A picture struggles to emerge. Nothing is proved. Nothing is denied.&#8217;</em>&#8221; (From the CD cover)</p>
<p><span id="more-2612"></span>Newly released on March 20, 2012, <em>The Stone </em>is the latest in David Olney&#8217;s thematic mini-album series. The cover art and song titles don&#8217;t leave much room for doubt as to what the theme is.  Although timed to be released just before Palm Sunday, this is not so much a religious recording as it is simply the telling of &#8220;the greatest story ever told&#8221; by one of America&#8217;s greatest storytellers.  As Ray Waddle, columnist for The Tennessean, said, &#8220;Olney is a folk/roots/rocker who comes at his occasional subject of faith from odd angles.  He writes about people on the periphery of revelation, witnesses rattled by a glimpse of the blinding light.  Whatever the subject, Olney is likely to stay in touch with an ancient theme of the human story &#8211; a heartsick restlessness, a longing for homecoming.&#8221;  <em>The Stone</em> follows this angle, approaching its subject from the outside looking in &#8211; in Olney&#8217;s words, &#8220;from the points of view of some of the peripheral characters. How did they respond to these events (whatever they were)? What in the world did they think was going on?&#8221;</p>
<p>Olney has used unusual perspectives in his songwriting before,  most notably in the song <em>Titanic. </em> While the Titanic may be most often associated with the hymn &#8220;Nearer My God to Thee,&#8221; or Celine Dione&#8217;s hit from the movie soundtrack, &#8220;My Heart Will Go On,&#8221; Olney&#8217;s song is uniquely written from the perspective of the iceberg.  It&#8217;s powerful, and it&#8217;s quite frightening in its intensity &#8211; just one demonstration of the talent of the songwriter who has penned these little mini-albums.</p>
<p><em>The Stone</em> develops its theme over six tracks (three previous compositions, plus three brand new songs) cleverly arranged in chronological order to tell the Easter story, beginning with the journey to Jerusalem and ending with the missing body. Olney admits he&#8217;s sure &#8220;something&#8221; happened, but isn&#8217;t convinced it happened as it has been handed down to us.  Not exactly the kind of stuff the Christian music industry would be interested in.   Still, with the exception of the imagined scenario for the motivation behind Judas&#8217; betrayal, the songs are not outside the realm of possibilities when stacked up against biblical records and Olney&#8217;s imagination brings a powerful human element into the 2,000-year-old story.  It takes a huge talent to pull off such a project, and Olney pulls it off very well.  Regardless of your personal beliefs, it will affect you &#8211; if for no other reason than for the sheer drama in which it is performed.</p>
<p>The opening track, &#8220;Jerusalem Tomorrow,&#8221; is a powerful spoken-word piece narrated by a con-man healer who &#8220;can&#8217;t make a dime&#8221; since a stranger came through town ahead of him who &#8220;has everyone convinced he&#8217;s for real.&#8221;  A backdrop of Sergio Webb&#8217;s acoustic guitar steadily drives the music forward as the story unfolds.  The song  appeared on one of Olney&#8217;s earlier albums, and was also a hit recorded by Emmylou Harris.   Next up is &#8220;Brays,&#8221; another previously recorded song completely reworked.  As one might expect from the title, it is sung from the perspective of a donkey who triumphantly enters the city of Jerusalem  as palm leaves are placed at its feet.  The musical arrangement is impressive, with some ingenious orchestration consisting of a low, beastly, cello-like sound coupled with reverberating higher notes that struck me as being similar to what is heard in a donkey&#8217;s braying.   The blues-rocking &#8220;Brains&#8221; picks up the pace with lyrics about the betrayal punctuated by a smoking harmonica.  We are then brought to the upper room with the song, &#8220;Flesh and Blood,&#8221; the only song that isn&#8217;t from a peripheral character&#8217;s point of view.  Rather, it juxtaposes the passover meal  eaten in &#8220;a faraway place, a faraway time&#8221; with the present, where it is still observed and held sacred by believers.  The track list returns to the periphery with the arrest, presented from the perspective of a thief and murderer in &#8220;Barabbas,&#8221; a previously released song composed in classic Olney storytelling fashion.  The final track is the chilling and somber &#8220;A Soldier&#8217;s Report,&#8221; which recounts a Roman soldier&#8217;s reluctant report to his superior in which he tries to explain the disappearance of the body under his watch.  It is a most effective ending to a very impressive mini-album.</p>
<p>Supporting musicians for <em>The Stone</em> are few, but more than adequate &#8211; Olney (vocal, guitar and harmonica), Jack Irwin (harpsichord, percussion and orchestrations), <a href="http://sergiowebb.bigcartel.com/">Sergio Webb</a> (classical guitar), and <a href="http://www.daveroe.net/">Dave Roe</a> (string bass).  &#8220;When we started recording these songs, I thought they would be complicated,&#8221; said Olney.  &#8220;More voices, more instruments.  But the songs have a peculiarity to them that called for a simple approach.  The sound is very minor key.  Like a voice inside your head.&#8221;<iframe style="width: 300px; height: 355px; display: block; position: relative;" src="http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/album=1759151636/size=grande2/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/" frameborder="0" width="300" height="355"></iframe></p>
<p>The first in the mini-album series debuted in May of 2011:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/images/B004Z1ZN0M/ref=dp_image_0?ie=UTF8&#038;n=5174&#038;s=music"><img id="prodImage" class="aligncenter" style="border: 0px;" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51UUd9k8h0L._SL500_AA300_.jpg" alt="David Olney Presents: FILM NOIR" width="300" height="300" border="0" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>“Downtown streets. Slick with Rain. Watch your step. Don’t talk to strangers.”</em></p>
<p>So says the blurb on Olney’s <a href="http://www.davidolney.com/">website</a> about his first EP in the series, <em>David Olney Presents: Film Noir.  </em>The words<em> </em>are the opening lyrics to its first song, “Frank is Gone,” and they set the stage for everything that follows on this five-song mini-album of ‘50s-‘60s detective music that artfully evokes that film noir atmosphere with “arrangements as smoky as Bogart’s ashtray,” as Rochester’s Democrat &amp; Chronicle puts it.</p>
<p>Indeed, this little mini-album drips with the atmosphere of film noir enough to wring it out like a rag. From the moment the ear catches the opening sinister-sounding riffs of a descending walking bass spilling from the speakers, the mind&#8217;s eye conjures up an image of a vintage movie screen where desperate and shady characters come to vivid life. We are introduced to characters like Frank, who abruptly skips town in a shroud of mystery, and to his girlfriend Gracie who “keeps the front light on” as she waits for him, but by the second track (“Blue Moon Hotel”) admits against a backdrop of a smoky, sultry sax that she thinks Frankie never made it. We get hints of a deal, and the double-cross, and we’re pretty sure who the man is who’s holed up in a cheap hotel room with just a bed, a blanket, and a pillow that amounts to not much more than a prison cell. Then there’s &#8220;$20 Serenade&#8221; about a robber who strikes up an amiable enough conversation with a stranger on the street until he pulls out a gun, but the tune is such a toe-tapper, it&#8217;s hard to get too concerned. There&#8217;s also a slow-grooving blues tune with a surprising and very effective muted organ adding to the mood set by the walking bass line and slow bluesy guitar strumming. Perhaps the best song on the EP is a remake of Olney&#8217;s previously released tune, “Sunset on Sunset Boulevard,&#8221; about a host of characters including an aging star who sips her martini and throws a glass at her TV as she shouts “those filthy swine have all forgotten; how dare they turn their backs on me!” The atmospheric ‘tinky-tink’ of piano keys from multi-instrumentalist and producer Jack Irwin, <a href="http://jimhokemusic.com/index.htm" class="broken_link">Jim Hoke&#8217;s</a> smoky saxophone, and some very impressive finger-picking from guitar maestro <a href="http://sergiowebb.wordpress.com/about/">Sergio Webb</a> (who, by the way, is an impessive artist well worth checking out) provide just the right finishing touches to this gem.</p>
<p>Independent weekly newspaper <em>Philadelphia City Paper</em> included <em>Film Noir</em> in its list of Top 10 Roots Albums of 2011, stating, &#8220;these dark stories and their perfect small jewels of cool jazz must be honored for offering fascinating listening, both lyrically and musically.&#8221; I wouldn&#8217;t argue with that. Give it a listen here:<iframe style="width: 300px; height: 355px; display: block; position: relative;" src="http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/album=2439622013/size=grande2/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/" frameborder="0" width="300" height="355"></iframe></p>
<p>While these two EPs are radically different from one another thematically, they share a similar sparse and (for the most part) smooth and easy musical blueprint.  That is not to say, though, that all of Olney&#8217;s 20+ albums are of this kind. He can rock to bring the house down, swing to a country stomp, and perform anything in between  remarkably well, as his discography proves.  (For those unfamiliar with Olney, I highly recommend starting with  <em><a href="http://www.loudhousemusic.com/davidolneythewheel.htm">The Wheel</a></em> or <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Omars-Blues-David-Olney/dp/B00004RDKN">Omar&#8217;s Blues</a></em>, two of his greatest achievements.)  But as good as Olney’s recordings are, audiences virtually all agree his live performances are even better.  The one word that is repeatedly used to describe them is <em>“intense.” </em> Few artists are able to so completely bring an audience under their spell as David Olney does.   He is on the road a lot, both throughout the U.S. and in Europe, so do yourself a favor and check his website for the touring schedule to catch a show near you.</p>
<p>One reason for Olney&#8217;s ability to captivate a live audience with such intensity is his love for theatrics.  When he sings songs about characters, he doesn&#8217;t just sing about them.  He inhabits them for as long as the song lasts.  “I think if I was ever going to do any other kind of self expression or artistic endeavor, I would probably be an actor,”  he says.  Along those lines, he has been publicly reciting classic poetry for the past several years and posting the performances on Youtube, where he is gaining a loyal viewing audience.  Here&#8217;s one fine example:<br />
<iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/kMopDnQ6ohM?rel=0" frameborder="0" width="420" height="315"></iframe><br />
As I said, I’m constantly amazed with what he comes up with next.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="     aligncenter" src="http://www.katecampbell.com/campkatebell2012/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/press1mini.jpg" alt="" /><br />
When country/folk-roots singer songwriter <a href="http://www.katecampbell.com/">Kate Campbell</a> opens her mouth to sing, you definitely know she’s from the Deep South – telltale signs ooze from her every syllable.  But this southern bred artist from Mississippi is no country bumpkin.  Her inherited country twang is tempered by a polished refinement and beautiful expression that adds irresistible charm to her voice, captivating audiences and drawing them into her southern world which is the birthplace of such notable writers as Harper Lee, William Faulkner, Eudora Welty and Flannery O’Connor.  Kate’s formative years were spent in Sledge, Mississipi during the height of the civil rights movement and much of her music is inspired by her coming-of-age experiences as a young middle-class white girl during those tumultuous times.  As the daughter of a Baptist minister, she was exposed to a heavy dose of spiritual singing, having grown up singing hymns out of the Baptist Hymnal that proclaimed a love for God and fellow man at a time and locale where paradoxical community attitudes abounded.  She also grew up listening to a melting pot of music on the radio, including country, folk, pop, R&amp;B and southern rock – all played on the same radio station.  Her songwriting is a hodge-podge of all these diverse influences.  Many of her compositions are autobiographical yet presented in a way that reveals the bigger picture of universal humanity, and her talent for singing her stories is every bit as evident as the talents of the authors previously mentioned whose works she admires and to whom she is often compared.  Her CD booklets frequently include some of her favorite quotes from these literary giants and others.</p>
<p><span id="more-2199"></span>Though she hasn’t broken through to mainstream super-stardom, those who take the time to discover Kate Campbell invariably become devoted fans.  Some of those fans were treated to two concert nights on April 8-9, 2010 at the Blue Rock Artist Ranch and Studio in Wimberley, Texas, where she was joined onstage by <a href="http://www.well.com/~wellvis/vanmeter.html">Sally Van Meter</a> on dobro, <a href="http://www.thecountryblues.com/artist-reviews/scott-ainslie/">Scott Ainslee</a> on guitar and banjo, and Don Porterfield on bass.  Selections from the concerts were recorded and released in September 2011 on Kate’s own independent record label to become her newest album, <em>Two Nights in Texas</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img id="prodImage" class="aligncenter" style="border: 0px;" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ZHkQHs9DL._SL500_AA280_.jpg" alt="Two Nights In Texas" width="280" height="280" border="0" /></p>
<p>For those unfamiliar with Kate Campbell, <em>Two Nights in Texas</em> is a perfect introduction to her music, with the performances giving a well rounded representation of Kate&#8217;s diverse works &#8211; a mix of southern blues, fun and quirky songs, original southern gospel compositions, and several of her signature songs about growing up in a racially divided place. Her backup band is spot on and the acoustics are excellent.</p>
<p>Hearing the live performances will make new listeners want to search out Kate&#8217;s entire discography to discover more treasures (of which there are plenty) &#8211; like &#8220;In My Mother&#8217;s House&#8221; on 1999&#8217;s <em>Rosaryville</em>.  I would hate to choose just one Kate Campbell song to own, but if I had to, this would be the one I would choose &#8211; a gorgeous autobiographical song that showcases just how charming Kate&#8217;s voice can be.  In the song&#8217;s chorus <em>(&#8220;the chimes in the hall / sound every hour&#8221;</em>), the melody and Kate&#8217;s lilting voice produce an extraordinary sound reminiscent of chimes.  It is Kate at her very finest.  New listeners will also want to hear the studio versions of the concert songs, where they are given a more fleshed out sound than what is possible with a recording in an intimate concert setting.  Audio samples from all her albums, including several full-length songs that can be streamed, are on her website.</p>
<p>So what advantage does<em> Two Nights in Texas</em> offer to those who already own her studio recordings?  Besides excellent live performances of some of Kate’s best songs and some entertaining commentary about a few of them, <em>Two Nights in Texas</em> includes two beautiful medleys you won’t hear on any of her studio albums.  One medley seamlessly joins the song, &#8220;Rosa’s Coronas,&#8221; (a touching song about a Cuban cigar factory worker who worries about her daughter and grandbaby who have fled the country for America), with &#8220;Lanterns on the Levee&#8221; (a pretty song of devotion that was included on Kate&#8217;s debut album which earned Kate an Indie Award nomination for Best Singer/Songwriter from the Association for Independent Music).  The medley serves as a beautiful closer to <em>Two Nights in Texas</em>.</p>
<p>The other medley – the standout track of the whole disk, without a doubt! – is the gorgeous 8-minute  “Steal Away Trilogy,” which joins three songs.  It begins with “Would They Love Him Down in Shreveport,” (a song made popular by George Jones and covered by numerous artists including B. J. Thomas),  gently slides into the gorgeous original composition “Peace Comes Stealing Slow” (with lyrics having obvious parallels to W.B. Yeats&#8217; poem, &#8216;The Lake Isle of Innisfree&#8217;), and then beautifully segues into the mid-19<sup>th</sup> century African American gospel tune, “Steal Away”  for an exquisite ending.</p>
<p>Also included on the live recording is &#8220;Jesus and Tomatoes,&#8221; which as fans know, is one of Kate&#8217;s funniest and most entertaining songs about an individual who seizes on the commercial opportunity to market a &#8216;holy image&#8217; seen on a tomato vine, only to be rebuked (<em>&#8220;I heard a knocking at my door / it was a lawyer for the lord, saying &#8216;don&#8217;t do this no more&#8217; / said, &#8216;come and dine with me / we&#8217;ll have a BLT&#8221;).  </em>Kate tells her Texas audience that she got the idea to write such a crazy song when she saw a sign in front of a fruit and vegetable stand that said &#8220;Jesus and tomatoes coming soon.&#8221;  &#8220;I knew immediately that was going to have to be a song,&#8221; she told them.   She also shared a little humor with her Texas audience about the song, &#8220;10,000 Lures,&#8221; a beautifully performed original gospel-oriented composition:  &#8220;So my momma says, &#8216;you know, Kate, I believe that song <em>could</em> go in the Baptist hymnal,&#8217; and I said, &#8216;I really don&#8217;t believe the word &#8216;voo-doo&#8217; has ever been in the Baptist hymnal!&#8217;   Another highlight is the ultimate car song, &#8220;Galaxie 500,&#8221; about a child&#8217;s memories of the family car with vinyl seats that &#8220;burned my legs on summer afternoons&#8221; and of hearing from the car&#8217;s radio the announcement that Martin Luther King had just been shot.   Kate also performs an excellent version of her much-loved song &#8220;New South,&#8221; about progress and how it has affected the modern-day south.</p>
<p>Of course, no concert would be complete without a few of Kate&#8217;s trademark songs about her experiences growing up in the south during the 1960&#8217;s, and <em>Two Nights in Texas</em> includes excellent live performances of three of them &#8211; &#8220;A Cotton Field Away&#8221; (a song about changes that swept southern society with forced desegregation while a black child and a white child remained a cotton field away), &#8220;Look Away&#8221; (a solemn, piano-driven anthem about the south&#8217;s &#8220;long and slow surrender retreating from the past&#8221;), and the iconic &#8220;Crazy in Alabama,&#8221; which probably is the one song that best captures the essence of Kate&#8217;s music (&#8220;<em>but the train of change was coming fast to my hometown / we had the choice to climb onboard or get run down</em>&#8220;).</p>
<p>Kate Campbell has contributed much to America&#8217;s repertoire of classic southern folk music.  With her most recent album of new material being released in 2008, it should only be a matter of time before we are treated to something new from this national treasure.  Considering her past achievements, it is a pretty sure bet that she will not disappoint.  In the meantime, I&#8217;ll settle for sitting back and enjoying the warmth and beauty of <em>Two Nights in Texas</em>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I confess to being a skeptic regarding best-of-year lists, though I suspect I am far from alone. The general arbitrariness of the exercise (my own list might look different if you asked me in a different week*) combines with inevitable comparison of apples and oranges (is it really possible to say that a given ambient release is slightly &#8220;better&#8221; than a given rock album?). What&#8217;s more, I usually fail to find my own listening reflected in most published lists (this year I trawled several prominent top 50 and top 100 lists and found almost zero overlap with my own personal list). Adding another may well be simply adding to the futility.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to go ahead though, largely because of the small chance that as a result someone might discover one of the titles listed below and come to love it. After all, I discovered several of them through the gratefully received recommendations of others. Moreover, each of these releases deserves to be noted on a list somewhere. I make no claim to judge cosmic significance, attribute enduring worth, or arbitrate taste. The following albums are simply 2011 releases that I&#8217;ve played many times each and that have left me delighted or fascinated and wanting to keep hearing them in 2012.</p>
<p>[*Addendum &#8211; as if purposely to prove this correct, two days after posting this list I discovered the album <a href="http://www.emusic.com/listen/#/album/farewell-poetry/hoping-for-the-invisible-to-ignite/12792119/:" title="Farewell Poetry" target="_blank">Hoping for the Invisible to Ignite</a> by <a href="http://www.farewell-poetry.com/" title="FareWell Poetry homepage" target="_blank">FareWell Poetry</a>; had I heard it a week earlier it would have made my top five.]</p>
<p><img class="alignleft" title="The Door in the Wall" src="http://f0.bcbits.com/z/14/40/1440439739-1.jpg" alt="" width="110" height="110" /><span id="more-1057"></span><br />
<strong>#20 Offthesky &#8211; <em>The Door in the Wall</em></strong><br />
Part of the intriguing <a title="Wist Rec Book Report Series" href="http://wistrec.com/the-book-report-ethos/" target="_blank">Book Report Series</a> by Wist Rec, in which musical interpretations of literary works are packaged with the relevant book, this 3&#8243; release offers a compelling musical reading of a short story by H. G. Wells (full review <a title="The Door in the Wall" href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//2011/11/the-door-in-the-wall/" target="_blank">here</a>). Offthesky&#8217;s full-length release <em>The Beautiful Nowhere</em> was another candidate for this list, but the added interest of music interpreting text and the story deepening the music lends extra weight to this excellent little electronic tone poem.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft" title="Meridians" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41IPgh%2BM0-L._SL500_SS110_.jpg" alt="" width="110" height="110" /><br />
<strong>#19 David Wenngren &amp; Christopher Bissonnette &#8211; <em>The Meridians of Longitude and Parallels of Latitude</em></strong><br />
This is simply an exceptionally fine ambient/drone release. Its aural textures are complex and interesting throughout, accented with subtle small sounds. As its grainy landscape ebbs and flows, it holds the attention from start to finish, sensitively balancing mood and forward motion. This is one that I will be returning to often.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft" title="Glimmer" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Wniw%2B7B4L._SL500_SS110_.jpg" alt="" width="110" height="110" /><br />
<strong>#18 Jacaszek &#8211; <em>Glimmer</em></strong><br />
Unashamedly pretty classical motifs emerge from a veil of grainy electronic murmurings, creating an ongoing tension between bright, disciplined clarity and gauzy, undulating currents and eddies of distortion. The effect is like hearing snatches of classical music through a window while standing on an incessantly rolling, creaking boat in the fog. An admirable restraint gives the whole a sense of delicacy.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft" title="La Lechuza" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61gbOFQCCOL._SL500_SS110_.jpg" alt="" width="110" height="110" /><br />
<strong>#17 Esmerine &#8211; <em>La Lechuza</em></strong><br />
The sophomore release from Esmerine (formed by members of GYBE and Silver Mt. Zion), <em>La Lechuza</em>, is more accessible, relaxed, and complex than the band&#8217;s debut and expands their musical palette. It moves from sparkling rhythmic patterns in which marimba and strings dynamically intertwine to poetic, softly yearning songs, with cello, harp and saxophone adding to the rich tones.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft" title="Tassili" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51DkEX1mvqL._SL500_SS110_.jpg" alt="" width="110" height="110" /><br />
<strong>#16 Tinariwen &#8211; <em>Tassili</em></strong><br />
I know folk who prefer their earlier albums, but to my ears the laid-back acoustic sound of <em>Tassili</em> is captivating. The sinuous, swaying rhythms and earthy vocals soon get under the skin, offering the sense of joining a campfire singalong in an unknown language. The lyrics are worth reading in translation also, weaving poetic tales of desert life.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft" title="The Long Surrender" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51bjosc6caL._SL500_SS110_.jpg" alt="" width="110" height="110" /><br />
<strong>#15 Over the Rhine &#8211; <em>The Long Surrender</em></strong><br />
<em>The Long Surrender</em> is my favorite Over the Rhine album of their last several releases. It contains the usual collection of memorable, thoughtful songs, wryly insightful lyrics, great vocals and understated accompaniment. It moved up on to this list in large measure because of &#8216;Infamous Love Song&#8217;, a magnificent return to the dramatically verbose poetry of early Over the Rhine material.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft" title="Hotel Monterey" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/4176xzu2m9L._SL500_SS110_.jpg" alt="" width="110" height="110" /><br />
<strong>#14 Minizza &#8211; <em>Hotel Monterey</em></strong><br />
A single 50+ minute piece of experimentation that begins with found sounds, moves through a variety of atmospheres and sound effects, and ends in blissful strumming, this album impresses with its constant shifts of sound, a surprise around every corner. This enables it to capture the attention more consistently than your average drone/environmental marathon. Don&#8217;t expect songs or tunes, but do expect an absorbing listen if you have the patience to tackle it.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft" title="Double Handsome Dragons" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/510xm1xo7bL._SL500_SS110_.jpg" alt="" width="110" height="110" /><br />
<strong>#13 Double Handsome Dragons &#8211; <em>Double Handsome Dragons</em></strong><br />
This one requires no patience at all. It is here not because it&#8217;s great art, but because it&#8217;s great fun. Boundless energy, an everything-plus-the-kitchen-sink approach to composition, and a collection of at times hilarious science fiction movie samples are stirred together into a manic and gleeful instrumental rock record that makes me want to move and always makes me smile.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft" title="Song of the Sibyl" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61OQ742NmHL._SL500_SS110_.jpg" alt="" width="110" height="110" /><br />
<strong>#12 Jordi Savall and Montserrat Figueras &#8211; <em>The Song of the Sibyl </em></strong><br />
I don&#8217;t buy very many classical recordings, and even less Christmas music, but this is gorgeous. Three versions of a liturgical chant performed in Mallorcan churches since the Middle Ages soar with timeless beauty. The singing is fine, and the instrumentation atmospheric. As my daughter put it, this is &#8220;epic&#8221;.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft" title="Recollage" src="http://luxusarctica.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/luxxar052001-01_150x150.jpg" alt="" width="110" height="110" /><br />
<strong>#11 Erik Nilsson &#8211; <em>Recollage</em></strong><br />
A <a title="Recollage" href="http://luxusarctica.wordpress.com/2011/01/17/recollage/" target="_blank">free download</a> from the Luxus-Arctica label, this release by Erik Nilsson delights at every turn. Cut up fragments of acoustic instruments, beats, and environmental sounds are painstakingly combined into an unfailingly tuneful and entertaining whole that transcends its techniques through sheer musicality. Perhaps the year&#8217;s best free release.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft" title="Dropped Pianos" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41QFjL8OsZL._SL500_SS110_.jpg" alt="" width="110" height="110" /><br />
<strong>#10 Tim Hecker &#8211; <em>Dropped Pianos</em></strong><br />
Tim Hecker&#8217;s <em>Ravedeath, 1972</em> earned a mention on many end of year lists; personally, I preferred the less heralded companion release. Presented as a series of sketches and outtakes from the <em>Ravedeath</em> album, it keeps the underlying piano recordings closer to the surface and offers a more sonorous, mysterious, and oddly melodic sound world than the finished manipulations of <em>Ravedeath</em>.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft" title="Or" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41QtL1rgUCL._SL500_SS110_.jpg" alt="" width="110" height="110" /><br />
<strong>#9 Kangding Ray &#8211; <em>Or</em></strong><br />
On this release Kangding Ray takes the stern, minimalist approach approach to techno characteristic of raster-noton stalwarts Alva Noto and Olaf Bender, defrosts it somewhat, and adds vocals and an overarching concept (<em>Or</em> is both the French word for gold and an English word denoting choice). The whole has a warmer sonic atmosphere than is typical for the genre. Great driving music.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft" title="Plains of the Purple Buffalo" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51klCKGVd0L._SL500_SS110_.jpg" alt="" width="110" height="110" /><br />
<strong>#8 *Shels &#8211;<em> Plains of the Purple Buffalo</em></strong><br />
The second album from *shels takes elements of post-rock and post-metal, blends in a few other musical accents, adds ecstatic, mostly wordless vocals and expansive melodies, and produces from the mix a joyous suite of songs that sway back and forth from the quiet and pretty to the soaring and grandiose. Listened to from start to finish it offers a sweeping journey that communicates joy in making music.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft" title="Univrs" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31q2gxM9CfL._SL500_SS110_.jpg" alt="" width="110" height="110" /><br />
<strong>#7 Alva Noto &#8211; <em>Univrs</em></strong><br />
The latest installment from the more club-oriented side of Carsten Nicolai&#8217;s musical psyche, <em>Univrs</em> (full review <a title="Alva Noto’s Univrs – Almost Human" href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//2011/11/alva-notos-univrs-almost-human/" target="_blank">here</a>) offers up more of the jagged, cerebral beats already heard on <em>Unitxt</em> and <em>Transform</em>. This release tops its predecessors, however, with a fascinating combination of geometry and motion. Complex and precise rhythms and warm buzzing textures dance elegantly around each other. Minimal techno at its finest.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft" title="The Beauty of Doubting Yourself" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41dh6KtPCdL._SL500_SS110_.jpg" alt="" width="110" height="110" /><br />
<strong>#6 Daniel Thomas Freeman &#8211; <em>The Beauty Of Doubting Yourself</em></strong><br />
This represents a rare and significant achievement: a drone album with a dramatic story arc. The shifting textures, each finely realized, move us from darkness through crisis into light. The album chronicles the artist&#8217;s experience of and emergence from depression; the sparing spoken word samples and track titles cast this as a story of salvation. Rarely has a drone album been so evocatively profound.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft" title="Felt" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31e0D7iJbwL._SL500_SS110_.jpg" alt="" width="110" height="110" /><br />
<strong>#5 Nils Frahm &#8211; <em>Felt</em></strong><br />
A collection of compositions for lightly prepared piano, Nils Frahm&#8217;s <em>Felt</em> combines meditative passages that stretch out and explore the resonance and decay of individual notes with compositions in which flurries of bell-like notes flutter like clouds of butterflies. This is an album that overflows with musicality. It&#8217;s an aural delight from start to finish.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft" title="A Winged Victory for the Sullen" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41U-37w4p6L._SL500_SS110_.jpg" alt="" width="110" height="110" /><br />
<strong>#4 A Winged Victory for the Sullen &#8211; <em>A Winged Victory for the Sullen </em></strong><br />
Bringing together Adam Wiltzie of Stars of the Lid fame and Dustin O&#8217;Halloran (see elsewhere on this list), the debut release by A Winged Victory for the Sullen gracefully occupies a place poised between neo-Romantic piano melodies and ambient drones. Absorbing and emotive, the album offers both moments of wistful melody and some of the richest sonic tapestries of any release this year.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft" title="Shizuku" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41-eyrR9ErL._SL500_SS110_.jpg" alt="" width="110" height="110" /><br />
<strong>#3 Illuha &#8211; <em>Shizuku</em></strong><br />
The 12k label has gone from strength to strength this year, releasing several candidates for this list. <em>Shizuku</em> is something special. In common with a number of recent 12k releases, it emerges from a bed of rustling small sounds used to build a gently shifting landscape in which the attention is drawn more to individual blades of grass and their slight movement relative to one another than to sweeping vistas. To this it adds melodic guitar, cello, and piano motifs, and also some dignified spoken word in Japanese. The results are filled with tender detail and laden with beauty.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft" title="Lumiere" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41Q2TJTZlUL._SL500_SS110_.jpg" alt="" width="110" height="110" /><br />
<strong>#2 Dustin O&#8217;Halloran &#8211; <em>Lumiere</em></strong><br />
On <em>Lumiere</em>, Dustin O&#8217;Halloran takes the simple, inviting piano compositions of his earlier releases and adds texture using electronics and strings. The results find him moving in similar territory to Max Richter or Ólafur Arnalds, creating luminous post-electronic chamber music. Tender and inviting, the brief compositions work fine as background music but also offer beauty enough for contemplation if made the center of attention.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft" title="Owl Splinters" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41NhNa7VCbL._SL500_SS110_.jpg" alt="" width="110" height="110" /><br />
<strong>#1 Deaf Center &#8211; <em>Owl Splinters</em></strong><br />
I&#8217;ve greatly appreciated the material released by Erik Skodvin and Otto Totland under a variety of names, and this year&#8217;s new release by Deaf Center is magnificent. Deeply resonant drones and the groan of distressed strings create atmospheres filled with brooding portent, and are interrupted by petite piano passages of fragile, crystalline beauty. Listening to the album is like walking through a dark, forbidding forest and happening across small clearings where springs are illuminated by thin, pure shafts of light. The attention to detail throughout is impressive &#8211; not a sound seems placed other than where it needs to be. There are some very dark passages, but in the end the light, delicate and vulnerable, wins out.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>This is part of a <a title="Music that has Influenced Me" href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//category/music-that-has-influenced-me/">series</a> on music that has influenced contributors to Metelaifne Music.</p></blockquote>
<p>I was a bona-fide “grown-up” before I realized there were all kinds of good music hidden away in a vast array of genres I never took the time to investigate. I suppose I am not unique. During our teen years, while some adventurous listeners may follow the beat of their own individual drum, most of us at this stage of life are typically influenced by what the airwaves are playing from the latest top-40 charts. None of the music from that early part of my life was, however, what I would call influential in defining my lasting musical preferences. It was only much later that some albums  began to seep into my ears and, in hindsight, I see how they proved to be landmark albums for me – albums which encouraged me to branch out into other genres, and once on that unbeaten path, find all those undiscovered treasures that awaited me. Here’s the ones that did it for me:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/images/B000008M54/ref=dp_image_0?ie=UTF8&#038;n=5174&#038;s=music"><img class="alignleft" style="border: 0px;" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41WA03HA7XL._SL500_AA300_.jpg" alt="Fisherman's Blues" width="240" height="240" border="0" /></a>I received this CD as a gift from a friend many years ago and, while I had vaguely heard of The Waterboys, I was not at all familiar with their music. From the moment I popped this CD into my player and heard those riotously glorious fiddle notes that open the first song, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VKouBHarIo">“Fisherman’s Blues,” </a>I was hooked. This was a sound very different from anything I had been musically exposed to previously. It was my springboard to the discovery of a whole new world of folk-rock with touches of traditional-sounding material by performers outside the U.S., which in turn, led me to more traditional folk tunes recorded by the likes of Fairport Convention, Richard Thompson, Steeleye Span, etc. <em>Fisherman’s Blues</em> is still a CD I play often.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/images/B000025ML6/ref=dp_image_0?ie=UTF8&#038;n=5174&#038;s=music"><img class="alignright" style="border: 0px none;" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/517GygeAjvL._SL500_AA300_.jpg" alt="Amazing Things" width="240" height="240" border="0" /></a><span id="more-703"></span>I first heard the album <em>Amazing Things</em> by the Scottish folk-rock band <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runrig">Runrig</a> playing through the computer speakers of one of my coworkers at work, who had obtained it from another coworker from Poland who, being from Europe, had had a much different exposure to music than I had thus far come across here in my own little American backyard.  It was one of those times you just have to ask, “What is that you’re playing?” It had a good strong rock beat, but different. It sounded a little tribal to me. And the lead singer’s voice was one of the best I’ve ever heard. The song was &#8220;Amazing Things&#8221; that first caught my attention and I still find it, well, amazing. I remember thinking at the time how nice it was to hear a song with such optimistic and uplifting lyrics, too. This album started me on a Runrig kick that lasted for years.  I still love their music, especially when they sing in Gaelic. (One of the best songs I have heard is Runrig’s live performance of &#8220;Loch Lomond&#8221; at the Loch Lomond outdoors concert included on the album <em>Celtic Glory</em>. Watch it <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzQ1pNfbe3Q">here</a>. The excitement of the audience participation adds to the thrill.) Runrig in turn led me to Wolfstone, Kris Drever, Damien Dempsey, Spirit of the West, etc.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/images/B000002LT2/ref=dp_image_0?ie=UTF8&#038;n=5174&#038;s=music"><img class="alignleft" style="border: 0px;" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5113DF703TL._SL500_AA300_.jpg" alt="The Visit" width="210" height="210" border="0" /></a>Loreena McKennitt’s <em>The Visit</em> introduced me to a beauty in music I didn’t know existed. This is, as my sister said when I introduced it to her, pure “balm for the soul.” When a friend loaned this album to me, I had never heard of Loreena McKennitt, but it didn’t take me long to discover her other albums. When I had pretty much exhausted them, I went searching for more “balm” and came across another landmark artist for me &#8211; <a href="http://www.conniedover.com/bio.shtml">Connie Dover</a>, whose style of music is similar to McKennitt’s but more focused on Scots-Irish/Celtic music without McKennitt’s world music influences.</p>
<p><img class="alignright" style="border: black 5px solid;" src="http://www.conniedover.com/if_ever.jpg" alt="" width="207" height="211" border="5" />Instead of <em>If Ever I Return</em>, I could just as easily have listed here Dover’s album, <em>Somebody – Songs of Scotland, Ireland and Early America, </em>since I purchased the two together<em>.</em>  The song <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrU7qGt0yYs">“La Fontaine”</a> demonstrates how beautiful Dover&#8217;s music is.  Both  albums are true angel’s music, and were equally influential in prompting me to search out other traditional Scots-Irish and English folk singers like Karan Casey, Kate Rusby, Dougie MacLean and others too numerous to mention. Dougie MacLean’s album, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Tribute/dp/B0054YQ3NK/ref=tmm_msc_title_0"><em>Tribute to Robert Burns, Neil Gow and Robert Tannahill</em></a> was one of particular influence. I don’t see how anyone could listen to the first track of that album and not be moved by its intense beauty.</p>
<p>Having gotten my feet wet with exposure to music from outside America, I delved into the edgier sound of Nordic music. Both <a href="http://realworldrecords.com/artists/varttina">Varttina</a> and <a href="http://www.noside.com/hedningarnabio.html" class="broken_link">Hedningarna</a> conditioned my Western ears further with their respective albums  <em><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W5QVUYt5Wo&#038;feature=related">Karelia Visa</a></em> and <em><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3V-etVIoVSs">Vihma</a></em> .</p>
<p>Back home on the other side of the Atlantic, I discovered how great folk music of the troubadours can be:</p>
<p>Richard Shindell’s <em><a href="http://www.richardshindell.com/index.php?page=cds&#038;display=57">Somewhere Near Paterson</a></em> was a real eye-opener for me. Here I discovered music that not only sounded good, but also really had something to say.  Shindell is a master story-teller through song and his stuff can make you either laugh, weep, or wonder with him, depending on which song you are listening to.  I now own all of Shindell&#8217;s CD’s and he has never made a bad record. His music led me to the discovery of scores of numerous other truly great folk music musicians, not the least of whom was <a href="http://www.gregbrown.org/">Greg Brown</a>, with his album <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Covenant-Greg-Brown/dp/B00004VWX1/ref=sr_1_1?s=music&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;qid=1323835031&#038;sr=1-1">Covenant</a></em> being another original eye-opener for me.</p>
<p>I also discovered a host of worthy albums in Americana (country-rock, alternative country, or whatever it is called).  Here&#8217;s the album that forged the way for me:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/images/B002KVSJFU/ref=dp_image_0?ie=UTF8&#038;n=5174&#038;s=music"><img class="alignleft" style="border: 0px;" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/517p50HZXgL._SL500_AA300_.jpg" alt="Anodyne (Vinyl LP)" width="210" height="210" border="0" /></a>Uncle Tupelo&#8217;s <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Anodyne/dp/B001QU446E/ref=sr_1_4?s=music&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;qid=1323836705&#038;sr=1-4">Anodyne</a></em> taught me just how edgy and rockin&#8217; country can be.   It led me to the wonderfully twangy artists Steve Earle, Lucinda Williams, Buddy and Julie Miller, and also the much under-appreciated R.B. Morris.  Morris&#8217; album, <a href="http://archives.nodepression.com/1999/09/r-b-morris-zeke-and-the-wheel/" class="broken_link"><em>Zeke and the Wheel</em></a>,  played a major role, as did The Jayhawks&#8217; <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hollywood-Town-Hall-Jayhawks/dp/B002D55IC0/ref=sr_1_2_digr?s=music&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;qid=1323838341&#038;sr=1-2" class="broken_link"><em>Hollywood Town Hall</em>. </a>   Topping the list of all of them was Steve Young&#8217;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Switchblades-Love-Steve-Young/dp/B000000FD9/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&#038;qid=1323838080&#038;sr=8-1"><em>Switchblades of Love</em>, </a> but I probably never would have discovered it or any of the rest without <em>Anodyne</em> starting me down that road.</p>
<p><img class="alignright" src="http://image.allmusic.com/00/amg/cov200/dre300/e315/e31560qpcmi.jpg" alt="Cover (Inspiration:Kelley Hunt)" />I began to dabble in blues.  The owner of the used CD store I frequented at the time handed me the CD  <em><a href="http://www.allmusic.com/album/inspiration-r502225">Inspiration</a></em> by Kelley Hunt to sample and it proved to be my “inspiration” for further investigation.  Hunt has a very low-registered, husky voice perfectly suited to the blues. She plays a very mean piano, too, and is backed by a very tight band. Her later albums became more country sounding, but <em>Inspiration</em>, her first, is more blues oriented.</p>
<p>Another influential record for me in blues-rock was Mark Selby’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/More-Storms-Comin/dp/B001EVEWBC/ref=tmm_msc_title_0?ie=UTF8&#038;qid=1323835617&#038;sr=1-1"><em>More Storms Comin’</em>.</a>  This is still one of my desert island disks. It led me backward to pure blues with Mississippi Fred McDowell’s <a href="http://www.allmusic.com/album/i-do-not-play-no-rock-n-roll-r228594"><em>I Do Not Play No Rock ‘n’ Roll</em>, </a>which in turn catapulted me forward to <a href="http://www.sonnylandreth.com/">Sonny Landreth </a>, <a href="http://www.davidjacobs-strain.com/Strain/">David Jacobs-Strain </a>, <a href="http://harrymanx.com/">Harry Manx</a> , <a href="http://www.chriswhitley.com/index.php" class="broken_link">Chris Whitley </a>(particularly his album, <em><a href="http://www.chriswhitley.com/index.php?id=lwtl" class="broken_link">Living With the Law</a></em>) and others.</p>
<p>The disk that made a baroque music lover out of me (something I thought was impossible to do) was, strangely enough, a children&#8217;s CD:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/images/1895404770/ref=dp_image_0?ie=UTF8&#038;n=5174&#038;s=music"><img class="alignright" style="border: 0px;" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51J367NGTQL._SL500_AA300_.jpg" alt="Vivaldi's Ring of Mystery (Audio CD)" width="210" height="210" border="0" /></a>I had  bought <em>Vivaldi’s Ring of Mystery</em> for the kids, never dreaming I would become so taken with it. It is one of a <a href="http://www.childrensgroup.com/product.php?mode=cat&#038;cid=classic_eng">series of disks </a>focusing on classical music through storytelling. I gave it a listen while driving home from work and it held my attention throughout.  The story had not ended by the time I got home but,  not wanting to be left hanging, I finished it up immediately afterwards.   As I listened, it occurred to me that I never knew how many layers one piece of music could have. It was like audio in 3-D.  The solo violin parts I found achingly beautiful and expressive – at times it sounded as if the instrument were crying. From this unlikely experience of listening to a child&#8217;s disk, I was  prompted to investigate classical music CD’s.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft" style="border: 0px;" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41PV6MA3VDL._SL500_AA300_.jpg" alt="Vivaldi: Concert for the Prince of Poland" width="210" height="210" border="0" />I chose a baroque recording &#8211; Andrew Manze’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Vivaldi-Concert-Prince-Poland-Antonio/dp/B00006644L/ref=sr_1_1?s=music&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;qid=1323839136&#038;sr=1-1"><em>Vivaldi: Concert for the Prince of Poland</em>, </a>mainly because it was Vivaldi (whose works I had heard on the children’s disk), but also because I was intrigued by the ensemble’s name (Academy of Ancient Music), and the reference to a concert for the prince of Poland in the title, which I thought appealingly old and regal. It was the Concerto in D Minor, RV540 (tracks 7-9) on the disk that really struck a chord with me. It is a marriage of strings and lute all wrapped up in a gorgeous melody that sounds like a “song,” as opposed to elevator music (which is what I previously supposed all classical music was). From there on, I discovered more beauty in the compositions of Bach, Handel, Telemann and a host of other baroque composers. Now that I have discovered the wonders of baroque music, I will never be far from it.</p>
<p>What was even more amazing to me than finding I had grown to love baroque music, though, was discovering I could also love opera.  Opera had been, for me, definitely in the same category as scratching on a chalkboard. I shunned it like the plague, even after becoming infatuated with instrumental baroque. What turned things around for me was this disk:</p>

It is a soundtrack of a French movie by the same title of the lives of viola da gamba master and pupil, Saint Colombe and Marin Marais. There is one very long vocal track here (track 9) for two female voices.  It is very lovely and hypnotic. This one selection cured my aversion to very high-pitched vocals. I was now ready to openly listen to vocals in baroque music. I started with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Handel-duetti-damore-Banditelli-Galante/dp/B000005W57/ref=sr_1_1?s=music&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;qid=1323868467&#038;sr=1-1"><em>Handel &#8211; Arie e duetti d&#8217;amore</em> </a>by Sandrine Piau, Gloria Banditelli, and Europa Galante/Fabio Biondi.  It has been discontinued and is very hard to find now. Probably the next most influential CD featuring vocal baroque music which prepared me for opera was a disk by La Serenissima:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/images/B0007G8M6Q/ref=dp_image_0?ie=UTF8&#038;n=5174&#038;s=music"><img class="alignleft" style="border: 0px;" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51VQfQZb75L._SL500_AA300_.jpg" alt="Vivaldi: Music for the Chapel of the Pietà" width="210" height="210" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>There are baroque albums with even more beautiful voices than La Serenissima&#8217;s <em><a href="http://www.culturekiosque.com/klassik/cdreview/vivaldi_pieta.html">Antonio Vivaldi: Music for the Chapel of the Pieta</a></em>, but this is the disk that made me realize how much the voice adds to the beauty of the instruments in baroque music.  Coming to vocal baroque music from the strictly instrumental perspective  of my previous exposure, my ears naturally concentrated on the instruments when I heard this album, inversely keeping the prominent voice in the background.  With this listening technique, it soon became apparent (and this was a real revelation to me), how the voice can weave in and out, over and under and through the strings, adding a whole new layer to the music which enriches the overall sound 10-fold.  I still listen to baroque music this way.  While I used to go out of my way to avoid vocals in baroque, I actually prefer their presence now.  I eventually graduated to listening to whole operas which I get immense pleasure from.</p>
<p>I had ventured into jazz territory numerous times. I really tried to like it. I purchased numerous used copies of various jazz CD’s in an attempt to find something that clicked for me, but each one fell flat. In fact, much of what I listened to I just plain disliked. I <em>should</em> like jazz, I thought. What was wrong? I gave up. Then a good friend of mine handed me the disk <em>The Best of Art Pepper</em> during a time in my life when I was deeply entrenched in baroque music – I had been listening to nothing but baroque for probably 6 or 8 months. What a shock! I can’t describe what a strange visceral feeling those unconventional bass lines infected me with. Not in a good way, either. I resigned myself to the fact that jazz music was not for me. Then my friend switched gears and handed me this:</p>
<p><img class="alignright" src="http://image.allmusic.com/00/amg/cov200/drd800/d851/d85122tyc88.jpg" alt="Cover (Up a Lazy River:Sidney Bechet)" />The classic swing jazz of Sidney Bichet’s <em><a href="http://www.allmusic.com/album/up-a-lazy-river-r423999">Up a Lazy River</a></em> pushed the right buttons for me. From there, I found an even more impressive disk: Louis Armstrong’s <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Armstrong_Plays_W.C._Handy">Armstrong Plays W.C. Handy</a></em>. In my honest opinion, there has never been a song before or since that surpasses the excitement heard in Armstrong’s version of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgan3HBpyJc">“Chantez les bas”</a>.  It starts out slow and gentle with characteristic Armstrong vocals, but just wait a little bit and you will hear Trummy Young’s amazing trombone kick in. From there on, it is a riotous celebration of horns that continually builds to the most powerful musical climax. Oh, those horns! I get immense pleasure out of playing this one <em>loud, loud, loud</em>.  From these two albums, I went on to discover the great clarinet players, Pee Wee Russell (whose music I would describe as &#8220;classy jazz&#8221;), Albert Nicholas (whose album <em><a href="http://www.allmusic.com/album/kornhaus-theater-baden-1969-r297448">Baden 1969 </a></em> is still one of my favorites) and trumpet officianado <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buck_Clayton">Buck Clayton</a>, as well as European and Scandinavian bands that explored and built upon classic swing jazz such as the <a href="http://www.dscband.nl/">Dutch Swing College Band </a>and Danish sax man <a href="http://www.allmusic.com/album/strike-up-the-band-r472920/review">Jesper Thilo</a> &#8211; also jazz singers Ella Fitzgerald and the lesser known (to audiences, but not to jazz musicians) <a href="http://jazzmatters.wordpress.com/2011/05/22/long-live-the-queen/">Maxine Sullivan</a>.    Last but not least was the incredible blues/jazz singer, <a href="http://100beautifulsongs.tumblr.com/post/3068464947/echoes-of-a-voice-stilled-too-early-the-death-of-eva" class="broken_link">Eva Cassidy</a>.</p>
<p>There you have it &#8211; the landmark albums that opened the door to broadening my musical horizons.  Once having stepped over that threshold, I have encountered countless worthy recordings previously unbeknownst to me.  I am still on the journey, and each corner I round seems to bring new delights.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is the first article in a series where Metelaifne Music contributors discuss the albums that have most influenced them musically. They will include some favourites that they play regularly now, but other choices will be music that they rarely listen to anymore, but had a major influence on their musical development at the time.<br />
My selection begins with the Beatles:</p>
<img src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61I5KdinQlL._SL500_AA300_.jpg" alt="" />
<p>The Beatles inevitably had a major influence upon me musically as I was teenager in their early days. For me this is a turning point album moving from the early fairly straight forward recordings that could be replicated on stage to the later studio based albums like <em>Sgt Pepper</em>. To some extent it reflects my growing up as a person alongside the Beatles &#8216;growing up&#8217; musically. It is still an album I play regularly with many standout tracks for me such as &#8220;Dr Robert&#8221; and &#8220;Got to Get You Into My Life&#8221;.</p>
<p><span id="more-664"></span><img src="http://cdn.umg3.net/rollingstones/files/imagecache/album_cover/albums/aftermath_uk.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>I never took sides in the UK Beatles versus Stones debate. I liked both. They moved me on musically towards a more blues based musical style. Some of the tracks reflect the growing influence of drugs upon their work &#8211; naively though as a 14 year old I never realized what &#8220;Mother&#8217;s Little Helper&#8221; was about at the time.</p>
<img src="http://images.uulyrics.com/cover/j/john-mayall-the-blues-breakers/album-bluesbreakers-with-eric-clapton.jpg" alt="" />
<p>The late 1960s was a period in the UK when the blues became popular, especially when played live. One of the key musical influences for me has been Eric Clapton, and this is where it started. It is difficult to choose even a couple of tracks to highlight, as all are so good, but &#8220;Key to Love&#8221; and &#8220;Ramblin&#8217; On My Mind&#8221; are two of my favourites.</p>
<p><img src=" http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51xqMG668cL._SL500_AA300_.jpg" alt="" /><br />
This was the album that led me to folk music. After enjoying this I moved to some of their earlier LPs, and from those to folk music, especially live in folk clubs. A particular favourite track is &#8220;America&#8221;. Fifty years on I still want to get on a Greyhound bus to explore America!</p>
<img src="http://www.themusiclibrary.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/after-the-gold-rush.jpg" alt="" />
<p>This just means college to me! I was developing musically, and to some extent Neil Young was the key artist in this progression, leading me to a number of west coast bands. This was the first LP of his that I owned &#8211; key tracks are&#8221;Southern Man&#8221; and &#8220;Only Love Can Break Your Heart&#8221;.</p>
<img src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41R42VtBabL._SL500_AA300_.jpg" alt="" />
<p>Another college record. Never a hit in the UK, but always a student favourite. It summed up the aspirational California lifestyle for us. Standout tracks for me are &#8220;Alone Again Or&#8221; and &#8220;Old Man&#8221;.</p>
<img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_OJJpNOgHjAU/SmUS6djSNHI/AAAAAAAAAiI/QfWHVkgkO2Q/s400/Songs+In+The+Key+Of+Life.jpg" alt="" />
<p>Such a variation of styles of music. I love &#8220;Sir Duke&#8221; &#8211; one of my top ten all-time tracks, so I couldn&#8217;t miss this out. My father played in swing bands and this track gets nearest to that in this list.</p>
<img src="http://img.amazon.ca/images/I/51%2BAYG1DdGL._SL500_AA300_.jpg" alt="" />
<p>There was a lot of hype about Bruce Springsteen when he first came to the UK. As soon as I heard the first few notes of <em>Born to Run</em> I knew why. I have never ever heard anyone perform live that surpasses the Boss for me. Still the CD that I turn to when I want to hear some rock. One of the key three albums on this list. Going to a Bruce Springsteen concert for me is a bit like going to Church! The audience knows their parts virtually automatically, like liturgy for a congregation.</p>
<p><img src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51N0eQBZygL._SL500_AA300_.jpg" alt="" /><br />
I could listen to the title track daily and never tire of it. This CD introduced me to West African music. When listening to Malinka and Woloff speaking artists from Senegal, Mali and The Gambia you begin to realise the influence that their music has had upon western music through the slave trade taking people to the southern USA and West Indies. &#8220;Immigres&#8221; is the key track for me.</p>
<img src="http://cosmicjazz.co.uk/images/2010/01/kind-of-blue-02.jpg" alt="" />
<p>I did not discover this until its 50th anniversary &#8211; how did I miss it? I read a review on its re-issue in the Guardian and went out to buy it to discover what it was all about. I was totally taken in by it &#8211; a beginning of an interest in a new genre.</p>
<img src="http://files.list.co.uk/images/2010/02/15/ali-farka-toure-and-toumani-diabate-ali-and-toumani-TLST069951.jpg" alt="" />
<p>As I explored West African music more I began to really like the Kora as an instrument. Here the guitar and kora come together with two of the leading players. Sadly this was guitarist Ali Farka Toure&#8217;s last recording before he died. &#8220;Kala Djula&#8221; and &#8220;Sabu Yerkoy&#8221; are the two tracks I like most, although all are favourites.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="http://images.emusic.com/music/images/album/120/908/12090868/300x300.jpeg" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></p>
<p>Only in the last year or so have I developed my interests in jazz further. This exemplifies what is good in contemporary jazz for me &#8211; haunting themes, especially led by Benjamin Koppel&#8217;s saxophone playing. Again, this is one of the albums that spurred me on to explore the genre further, developing in ways I would never imagine. That is why Metelaifne Music for me!</p>
<p>Near misses &#8211; too many! Some of these I don&#8217;t listen to as much now as when they were released, hence being on this list rather than the first list, but at the time they were key recordings for me</p>
<p><em>Layla and Other Love Songs</em> &#8211; Eric Clapton<br />
<em>Moondance</em> &#8211; Van Morrison<br />
<em>Led Zeppelin</em> <em>II</em> &#8211; Led Zeppelin<br />
<em>The Nightfly</em> &#8211; Donald Fagen<br />
<em>Thriller</em> &#8211; Michael Jackson<br />
<em>But Seriously</em> &#8211; Phil Collins<br />
<em>Deja Vue</em> &#8211; Crosby, Stills and Nash<br />
<em>Tapestry</em> &#8211; Carol King<br />
<em>Chicago Transit Authority</em> &#8211; Chicago: This was a very near miss. I still listen to it often, enjoying the jazz/big band/rock fusion.</p>
<p>Inevitably many of my choices come from an era when I was developing musically. So being based in the UK and born in 1950 the Beatles became the major early influence. Since then the key artist has to be Bruce Springsteen for me. Although I have developed interests into other genre over the years, Bruce is always the artist I come back to when I want something comfortable that I know well. I have chosen something from each decade of my life in my selection. I am still exploring music, furthering an interest in jazz and beginning to listen to some classical music. To summarise, John Miles sings it:</p>
<p>Music was my first love<br />
And it will be my last<br />
Music of the future<br />
And music of the past</p>
<p>To live without my music<br />
Would be impossible to do<br />
In this world of troubles<br />
My music pulls me through</p>

Indeed, the comparison to the role of the basso continuo in Baroque music would seem to hold. My own prejudices about mountain culture perhaps deserved more scrutiny.</p>
<p><a title="Give Me The Banjo -- PBS" href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&#038;rct=j&#038;q=%22give%20me%20the%20banjo%22&#038;source=web&#038;cd=1&#038;ved=0CCQQFjAA&#038;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.pbs.org%2Farts%2Fexhibit%2Fgive-me-the-banjo%2F&#038;ei=-e2-TuOVG6ro0QGe9LTcBA&#038;usg=AFQjCNHkVE2-G7_broGJfZ4KoWstSAO6ww&#038;cad=rja"><em>Give Me The Banjo</em></a>, the documentary that just aired nationally on PBS and <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&#038;rct=j&#038;q=%22give%20me%20the%20banjo%22&#038;source=web&#038;cd=4&#038;ved=0CDYQtwIwAw&#038;url=http%3A%2F%2Fvideo.pbs.org%2Fvideo%2F2164506461%2F&#038;ei=-e2-TuOVG6ro0QGe9LTcBA&#038;usg=AFQjCNE9p3ofCHskTE7juagXkpVXw-okdQ&#038;cad=rja">can be viewed online</a>, provides more perspective. The banjo is at the middle of a nation&#8217;s long struggle to understand both its genius and its divisions. The product of <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&#038;rct=j&#038;q=%22give%20me%20the%20banjo%22&#038;source=web&#038;cd=2&#038;ved=0CCoQFjAB&#038;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thebanjoproject.org%2F&#038;ei=-e2-TuOVG6ro0QGe9LTcBA&#038;usg=AFQjCNHEHrbdTuSp_1ngzpyVDbadqaTzeg&#038;cad=rja">The Banjo Project</a>, a nine-year oral history, the documentary could not come at a more appropriate time, just as the instrument is enjoying a renaissance. Pricier and heavier than the ukulele, the other instrument of the moment, the banjo rings authenticity for a new cosmopolitan generation. It is genuine. It is restless. And as narrator Steve Martin has “banjoked” in the past, it is the sound of happiness.</p>
<p>The documentary begins, luckily for me, with the banjo&#8217;s role as a symbol of African-American culture. Giving only a casual explanation of the instrument&#8217;s genesis and its refinement by slaves, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Sweeney">Sweeney</a>&#8216;s <a href="http://chnm.gmu.edu/courses/jackson/minstrel/minstrel.html">black-faced minstrel</a> sets off a wider discussion about how the banjo was a caricature of African-Americans. No other part of the film better attempts to connect the instrument to social changes and a broader public consumed with understanding its identity. Indeed, the efforts of enthusiasts and scholars to balance the story of racism with the genius of American music makes the beginning sections somewhat explosive.</p>
<p>Sections on Gus Cannon, Charlie Poole, and Pete Seeger connect the banjo to the mobility of Americans in the early 20th century. <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&#038;rct=j&#038;q=gus%20cannon&#038;source=web&#038;cd=1&#038;ved=0CCcQFjAA&#038;url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FGus_Cannon&#038;ei=tO6-TqWZOcTy0gG9hpWuBA&#038;usg=AFQjCNHb-Ozc03eKiegRZM7uWpYyJATcbw&#038;cad=rja">Gus Cannon&#8217;s</a> story is interwoven with interviews with the Carolina Chocolate Drops&#8217; <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&#038;rct=j&#038;q=don%20flemons&#038;source=web&#038;cd=2&#038;ved=0CDwQFjAB&#038;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.carolinachocolatedrops.com%2Fabout%2Fshow%2Fdom_flemons&#038;ei=5O6-ToK2M6P10gGe8u3tBA&#038;usg=AFQjCNHCyBqBTVncp954gNAsr6bVDGIpQw&#038;cad=rja">Dom Flemons</a>, who helps to make cannon&#8217;s jug band blues sound vibrant. This is the film at its most irresistible, feeling both erudite and homespun at the same time. By the time “<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AGpHS9sIOc">Walk Right In</a>” becomes a revival hit in the 1960s, it&#8217;s hard to see Cannon as anything other than a genius who wrested the black image from the minstrels.</p>
<p><span id="more-37"></span>Like Cannon, <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&#038;rct=j&#038;q=charlie%20poole&#038;source=web&#038;cd=1&#038;ved=0CCcQFjAA&#038;url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FCharlie_Poole&#038;ei=Mu--TsKXLeLX0QGm6YT1BA&#038;usg=AFQjCNFZ3SbXRS6mfW_ATZxzYzv8XGuPTQ&#038;cad=rja">Charlie Poole</a> is the perfect archetype of the rambler caught up in modern labor migrations. The banjo holds together the narrative of drunkenness and moral lapse.  It is the sound of the daily struggle and sense of fate in the 20s and 30s. <a href="http://www.peteseegermusic.com/">Pete Seeger</a>&#8216;s banjo is the tool to bring culture and politics to the people. His strumming style gave urgency to folk songs that were becoming part of the broader American consciousness. Moreover, his instructional materials made all instruments, not just the banjo, more accessible.</p>
<p>The film loses steam when it reaches <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&#038;rct=j&#038;q=earl%20scruggs&#038;source=web&#038;cd=1&#038;ved=0CDAQFjAA&#038;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.earlscruggs.com%2F&#038;ei=gO--ToHoEqb50gHO793lBA&#038;usg=AFQjCNHmSgD0ZUnkaKHlA-f4sViEl761Pw&#038;cad=rja">Earl Scruggs</a>. Although the film portrays it coming into its prowess, it seems as if the banjo lost its cultural importance. It&#8217;s merely playing a role in Bluegrass, completing it, but no longer reflecting broader social trends. Yet Bluegrass is the expression of Appalachian culture coping with modernity, something which is completely lost to the film. Perhaps the interviewees were unwilling to examine their own assumptions about the relationship between Bluegrass and tradition. However, I was left wondering why <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banjo_roll">Scruggs&#8217; third finger</a>, which created that rolling, unceasing pointillism, was more important than Cannon&#8217;s slide or Seeger&#8217;s hammer-ons and pull-offs. How does the banjo move the “high and lonesome”? Did the instrument of the people lose out to the virtuoso?</p>
<p>After <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&#038;rct=j&#038;q=mike%20seeger&#038;source=web&#038;cd=1&#038;ved=0CCcQFjAA&#038;url=http%3A%2F%2Fmikeseeger.info%2F&#038;ei=FPC-TvH2FOPw0gHX6O3cBA&#038;usg=AFQjCNHB5J3eHdLuq2MXGVkeFpSGWfq-LQ&#038;cad=rja">Mike Seeger</a> (RIP) explains how the banjo is a conduit to rediscovering America&#8217;s rural traditions, the rest of the film focuses on those who bring greater musicianship and technique to the instrument. Of course, the film ends by reminding us that the banjo never goes away, that it is always a vehicle for communities to gather, share and celebrate. The film never takes on the air of a Ken Burns&#8217; documentary.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it&#8217;s hard not to note what&#8217;s left out. The banjo-ukes, mandolin banjos, guitar banjos appear almost entirely in archival footage. The tenor banjo, a staple of Celtic music, receives only brief mention. These inventive hybrids of the banjo were important to early acoustic and electric recording as engineers struggled to find instruments that could project adequately. The sound of the Jazz Age record was the sound of the banjo. This is a film about the five-string banjo and, arguably, its place in Bluegrass. There is little of Bourbon Street.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, <strong><em>Give Me The Banjo</em></strong> is a loving portrait that might encourage someone to drop some bills on some of Cannon&#8217;s Jug Stompers, maybe the Bluegrass Boys, or 50s and 60s folk. It may even inspire more extravagant purchases. If anything, <strong><em>Give Me The Banjo</em></strong> should encourage a wider audience to see the banjo not as a product of America&#8217;s backwaters, but the meeting place of rural and modern America. OK, give me the banjo, just get someone else to play it.</p>
