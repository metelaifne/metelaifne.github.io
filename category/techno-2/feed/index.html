				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As I prepared <a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//2016/12/top-20-of-2016-david-smith/">this year&#8217;s top 20 list</a>, I discovered that several of my favorite releases this year were not full albums, but brief EPs. Including them in the top 20 albums list felt a bit like trying to compare novels and short stories, so I decided to list them separately. These were my top 5 favorite EPs of 2016:</p>

A wonderful surprise at the end of the year: three Pjusk collaborations. Loscil, Porya Hatami, and SHAO add their musical perspectives, and the distinctive sound of Pjusk remains present in each track. Brilliant stuff.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><br />
<img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5360" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/top-20-of-2016-david-smith/bolton-lichen-150x150.jpg" alt="bolton-lichen" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/top-20-of-2016-david-smith/bolton-lichen-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/top-20-of-2016-david-smith/bolton-lichen-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/top-20-of-2016-david-smith/bolton-lichen.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" />#2. <a href="https://wilbolton.bandcamp.com/album/lichen">Wil Bolton &#8211; Lichen</a></strong><br />
Fifteen minutes of warm, spacious, crackly, resonant, luxuriant sound. My favorite of Wil Bolton&#8217;s several releases this year. Check out his <a href="https://wilbolton.bandcamp.com/album/maemi"><em>Maemi</em></a> EP and the full-length <em><a href="https://wilbolton.bandcamp.com/album/february-dawn">February Dawn</a> </em>as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

My list had its share of gentleness this year, but for moments when something more hard-edged fit the bill, this short collection of rumbling minimalist techno in the classic raster-noton vein was an excellent stand-by.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><br />
<img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5363" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/top-20-of-2016-david-smith/Murcof-EP01-150x150.jpg" alt="murcof-ep01" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/top-20-of-2016-david-smith/Murcof-EP01-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/top-20-of-2016-david-smith/Murcof-EP01-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/top-20-of-2016-david-smith/Murcof-EP01.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" />#4. <a href="https://infine-rec.bandcamp.com/album/ep01">Murcof and Vanessa Wagner &#8211; EP01</a></strong><br />
By turns darkly brooding and gently melancholy, this turbulent-electronics-meets-Satie release stuck with me even after the full-length album that followed it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5364" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/top-20-of-2016-david-smith/Jazzdefector-150x150.jpg" alt="jazzdefector" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/top-20-of-2016-david-smith/Jazzdefector-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/top-20-of-2016-david-smith/Jazzdefector-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/top-20-of-2016-david-smith/Jazzdefector.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /><strong>#5. <a href="https://audiogourmet.bandcamp.com/album/miniatures">Jazzdefector &#8211; Miniatures</a></strong></p>
<p>Finally, something more relaxing. A series of very short pieces of effects-laden guitar offer a summery interlude, warm and pretty.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s been a quiet 2016 at <em>Metelaifne Music</em>. Professional commitments have left some regulars with less time for blogging. But we&#8217;re still listening. Here are my top 20 albums for 2016. I excluded compilations (though <a href="http://shop.serein.co.uk/album/orbital-planes-passenger-trains-vol-1"><em>Orbital Planes &amp; Passenger Trains, Vol. 1</em></a> from Serein, <a href="https://dronarivm.bandcamp.com/album/into-the-white-new-years-2016-free-compilation"><em>Into the White</em></a> from Dronarivm, and <a href="https://www.fat-cat.co.uk/release/eleven-into-fifteen-a-130701-compilation"><em>Eleven into Fifteen</em></a> from 130701 all delighted me). As ever, this is the best in my subjective judgment of what I heard and liked, no more, and the numbering is less important than the chance of helping someone find something good that they missed. This year I am treating EPs separately, <a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//?p=5331&#038;preview=true">in a second post</a>.<span id="more-5329"></span></p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5357" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/top-20-of-2016-david-smith/durand-traves-150x150.jpg" alt="durand-traves" width="200" height="200" srcset="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/top-20-of-2016-david-smith/durand-traves-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/top-20-of-2016-david-smith/durand-traves-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/top-20-of-2016-david-smith/durand-traves.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" /></p>
<p><strong>#1.</strong> <a href="https://federicodurand.bandcamp.com/album/a-trav-s-del-espejo"><strong>Federico Durand – A Través Del Espejo</strong></a><br />
This delightful album was released on 12k early in the year, and I kept listening to it all year. (My wife liked it too, which is far from guaranteed with the more experimental fringes of my listening.) A childlike celebration of tiny, fragile sounds, and a reminder of what can be destroyed by noise and bombast, this album offers a series of delicate meditations on the vulnerable beauty of sound. Durand&#8217;s <a href="https://federicodurand.bandcamp.com/"><em>Jardín de invierno</em></a> (on Spekk) deserves honorable mention in the same vein, but it was this earlier release that captivated my ears the most this year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>#2. <a href="https://play.spotify.com/album/2EvZiOMBlC9b5hbjbZCjZv?play=true&#038;utm_source=open.spotify.com&#038;utm_medium=open">Nicolas Jaar &#8211; Sirens</a></strong><br />
The haunting first track displays magnificently Jaar&#8217;s precise mastery of his palette of sounds. The album continues with a compelling sideways take on a variety of song forms, with the thematic focus on a culture of political violence providing a dark textual undercurrent. A remarkable piece of work, whether one focuses on the catchy songs, on the textual warnings, or on the meticulously shaped sonic shifts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5351" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/top-20-of-2016-david-smith/Sunergy-Smith-150x150.jpg" alt="sunergy-smith" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/top-20-of-2016-david-smith/Sunergy-Smith-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/top-20-of-2016-david-smith/Sunergy-Smith-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/top-20-of-2016-david-smith/Sunergy-Smith.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></p>
<p>#<strong>3. <a href="https://kaitlynaureliasmith.bandcamp.com/album/frkwys-vol-13-sunergy">Kaitlyn Aurelia Smith &amp; Suzanne Ciani &#8211; Sunergy</a></strong><br />
An inspired set of Buchla synthesizer improvisations from a senior master of the art and a new rising star (Smith&#8217;s solo album <a href="https://kaitlynaureliasmith.bandcamp.com/album/ears"><em>Ears</em></a> this year was also excellent). Sequences burble and sparkle over shifting hums and currents, providing a compelling update to the long-form analog synthesizer genre.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><br />
<img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5348" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/top-20-of-2016-david-smith/schlarb-airports-150x150.jpg" alt="schlarb-airports" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/top-20-of-2016-david-smith/schlarb-airports-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/top-20-of-2016-david-smith/schlarb-airports-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/top-20-of-2016-david-smith/schlarb-airports.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" />#4. <a href="https://schlarb.bandcamp.com/album/plays-music-for-airports">Psychic Temple &#8211; Plays Music for Airports</a></strong><br />
What if Brian Eno&#8217;s classic ambient work, <em>Music for Airports,</em> were recorded as a jazz album? Chris Schlarb showed us this year that the results could be very enjoyable indeed. We also get a new, complementary piece, the &#8220;working man&#8217;s counterpart&#8221; to music for airports titled &#8220;Music for Bus Stops.&#8221; Both pieces charmed me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

An acoustic guitar meanders gently and peacefully as an unsettled bed of chirping, buzzing, warbling, squeaking electronics chatters tensely alongside, setting up a fascinating conversation that sometimes produces tension, sometimes converges.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><br />
<img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5345" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/top-20-of-2016-david-smith/MOstermeier-birds-150x150.jpg" alt="mostermeier-birds" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/top-20-of-2016-david-smith/MOstermeier-birds-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/top-20-of-2016-david-smith/MOstermeier-birds-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/top-20-of-2016-david-smith/MOstermeier-birds.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" />#6. <a href="https://homenormal.bandcamp.com/album/tiny-birds">M. Ostermeier &#8211; Tiny Birds</a></strong><br />
Building on last year&#8217;s <em>Still</em>, M. Ostermeier returned with an aptly titled collection of short, plaintive piano pieces. Accompanied by background rustles and rattles, the tracks are sparse, stark, melancholy, almost hesitant in their deliberation. The sound is intimate, inviting us to slow down and attend rather than carrying us along.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

David Newman&#8217;s recent releases have struck an absorbing balance between experimental exploration of the properties of sound and a melodic presence, and this collaboration with Justin Varis continues in the same rich vein. Remixes by various luminaries of the genre add a further dimension to this charming collection of off-kilter pieces.</p>

Korwar takes field recordings of folk music from Indian villages and marries them with jazz and electronics so skilfully that it is hard to see the joins. Raw recordings of chant and percussion from India provide the substrate that morphs into engaging jazz sequences that extend the sources without leaving them behind. A striking, unusual release.</p>

Loscil continues to find new angles on his distinctive sound, and his latest contains some of his most aggressive rhythms to date. It also serves up a fresh helping of his signature hypnotically shimmering pulses. I have never met a Loscil album I didn&#8217;t like, and this latest release more than kept the streak going.</p>

Resonant guitar notes follow one another at a gentle, leisurely pace. An ethereal atmosphere builds amid their resonance. Chiming rhythms eventually arrive, but only accentuate the calm. The album drifts by lazily, a slow caress.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

An evocative follow-up to Tiento de las Nieves, Tiento de la Luz offers a glacially paced interaction of piano, viola da gamba, and electronics. As usual with Köner, deep frequencies and extended textures play an important role, with the decay of each note held before us for contemplation. Mesmerizing listening.</p>

<p><strong>#12. <a href="https://slaapwel.bandcamp.com/album/filament">Gareth Davis &#8211; Filament</a></strong><br />
A rich, undulating, 35-minute drone, embedded in field recordings of the ocean, gains texture from the use of bass and contrabass clarinet along with electronics. Deep rumbles and whale-song-like squeaks ebb, and flow, and sway to deeply atmospheric effect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Native American sonic references may be a little hokey here and there, but the more I listened to this release from French jazz bass veteran Henri Texier the more the tunes sank their hooks into me. The live reprise released later in the year, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dakota-Mab-Live-Theater-G-tersloh/dp/B01CORX2WE/ref=tmm_msc_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&#038;qid=&#038;sr=" class="broken_link"><em>Dakota Mab</em></a>, is worth a listen too.</p>

<p><strong>#14 <a href="https://timereleasedsound.bandcamp.com/album/kaziwa">Porya Hatami and Arovane &#8211; Kaziwa</a></strong></p>
<p>Piano again, now heard through a rich haze of sonic manipulation, tinkling amid a crackle and rush of air, emerging from a busy hum, chiming like bells, meandering sadly, punctuating an ominous buzz. Porya Hatami and Uwe Zahn keep shifting the sonic palette a little, crowding the electronic atmosphere with portent as the piano soldiers bravely on.</p>

#15. <a href="https://machinefabriek.bandcamp.com/album/crumble">Machinefabriek &#8211; Crumble</a></strong><br />
This is not background music. It seems at any given moment as if little is happening, yet the whole unfolds in a way that feels tautly dramatic, like a small movie made of slight violin scrapes, hisses, metallic reverberations, wordless vocalizations, the sounds of something important happening, just over the horizon and almost out of earshot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Nils Frahm got together with some childhood friends to revisit and remix some tapes they had made decades ago. The result is a collection of atmospheric lo-fi instrumentals that somehow manage to sound reminiscent of Frahm&#8217;s solo work while being little like his previous material in form.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

McClure trades more in precise measures of sound than in tunes. Each track on this immersive, painstakingly crafted album invites the listener to meditate on a specific quality of carefully constructed sound, ranging from the nature-tinged water-and-hum of the opening track to almost-not-there gossamer drones and unexpected pulses.</p>

There are stretches in which this album sounds like a gaggle of synthesizers improvising by themselves, without human intervention. Bright, chiming sounds ripple and cascade merrily. Stick around, though, and the two long pieces begin to develop and morph, building into rich swathes of sound.</p>

Drone and noise, crackle and hum, chaotic dissolution of sound and a massive sense of grandeur &#8211; these are the basic building blocks of <em>Continuum</em>. Jebanasam sets out to capture &#8220;the spectrum of life, power and energy present in the universe&#8221; and emerges with a dramatic set of drone compositions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

The practically ungooglable title gave me some trouble tracking down this unusual release. It began from recordings of the sounds of bees in their hives and built instrumental compositions around the bee drones and buzzes. The music is pastoral, and the interweaving of natural and instrumental sounds is quite sensitively done.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here is my top 20 music releases for 2015, with no claim that they are somehow objectively the best or that I listened to everything anyone else did. I have found things that delighted me on other people’s lists, and the point of the exercise is not to replicate or compete with those lists but to highlight some things you may not have found, things that might delight you. The sequence changed every time I made a shortlist, so take the numbers with a pinch of salt – all of them could be at least plus or minus 5 on a given day.<span id="more-5218"></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>#1.</strong> <strong>Wil Bolton – Inscriptions</strong><br />
I have loved many of Wil Bolton’s releases, and this one was especially captivating, a cohesive suite of carefully textured ambient soundscapes of great warmth and delicacy. A delight for the ears from start to finish. Full review <a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//2015/12/review-inscriptions-by-wil-bolton/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>#2. Nils Frahm – Solo</strong><br />
Nils Frahm has had a prolific year, including a film score and electronic duets with Ólafur Arnalds, but where he remains unrivaled is as a painter of fragile intimacy on the piano. This collection of solo piano pieces did not disappoint, offering both slow affection and rhythmic drive.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>#<strong>3. Kari Ikonen Trio &#8211; Beauteous Tales and Offbeat Stories</strong><br />
From scampering piano romps to meditative arco bass passages, from stately melodies to discordant experimental interludes, this album charms with its variety and adds another thread to my fondness for Scandinavian piano jazz.</p>

Porya Hatami and Darren Mcclure – In-Between Spaces</strong><br />
A delicious marriage of McClure’s abstract tones and Hatami’s gently burbling textures, this joint essay in textured ambiance is gently reflective in mood, a continual, fragile, questing movement within a basic rest. Another excellent release for Hatami, and a fine companion to McClure’s excellent Primary Locations from earlier in the year.</p>

Esmerine &#8211; Lost Voices</strong><br />
Marimba, percussion and strings are the backbone of Esmerine’s moody miniatures. The music sometimes shares the ponderous majesty of related bands godspeed you! black emperor and Thee Silver Mt. Zion, but its idiom is more acoustic, rooted in marimba, strings and drums. Lost Voices builds gentle rhythms, passages of lyrical beauty, and outbreaks of restrained melodic intensity into a wistful and dramatic whole, arguably their best yet.</p>

Emily Hall – Folie à Deux</strong><br />
Ostensibly an opera about shared delusion and receiving cosmic messages from an electricity pylon, this charming release sounds more like ambient than opera. Pure, melodic voices meditate dreamily on madness and our relationship to each other and the world that speaks through our electric technologies to the accompaniment of electronic textures, creating a mesmerizing and delightful sound.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Kangding Ray – Cory Arcane</strong><br />
I expected this year’s blockbuster from the raster-noton label to be Alva Noto’s Xerrox 3 (which I liked, but am still growing to love), but in the short term at least was more impacted by Kangding Ray’s uneasily skittering techno. Intricate rhythms shift and collide, accompanied by a narrative about the decay of consumerist technological society yet carrying a visceral appeal as pure sound.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Abstract in concept (an exploration of our perception of sound in its relation to time) and in execution (a focus on sounds themselves and their tensions with one another), this album nevertheless also manages to cohere as a compelling and finely wrought listening experience. The second entry on this list from the Dronarivm label, which had a fine year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Dag Rosenqvist – The Forest Diaries</strong><br />
Rosenqvist had a busy year, but charmed me most with this disarmingly simple set of piano/organ meditations that combine stillness with an undercurrent of dissonance. Notes are allowed to linger and decay, giving time to absorb and reflect. Music for a thoughtful evening.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5241" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Deupree-150x150.jpg" alt="Deupree" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Deupree-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Deupree-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Deupree.jpg 590w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" />#11. Taylor Deupree and Marcus Fischer – Twine</strong><br />
Another serving of the distinctive kind of microscopic beauty that Deupree’s 12k label has been honing for many years now. Gently hissing tape loops undulate their way softly through time, sparsely dusted with gentle chimes and wobbles, seeping softly into the future.</p>

<p><strong>#12. En – City of Brides</strong><br />
En’s follow up to the excellent Already Gone uses their distinctive palette to good effect. Passages of calmly undulating drones sit in tension with densely layered flurries of sound that reach for a cascading majesty, all heard through a dreamy, blurring filter. A distinctive world to get lost in. Full review<a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//2015/12/review-city-of-brides-by-en/"> here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>#13 Seckou Keita &#8211; 22 Strings</strong></p>
<p>This album offers elegant, and life-affirming instrumentals by a master kora-player from Senegal, a few of them accompanied by gentle vocals. African and Western sensibilities interweave in the compositions, and the sound is delicate and warmly inviting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>#14 Goldmund &#8211; Sometimes</strong></p>
<p>Another entry in the atmospheric piano miniatures genre, this deeply melodic and contemplative album combines the gentle piano gestures with light electronic washes to create a beautiful sonic landscape that invites introspection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5235" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Port-st-willow-150x150.jpg" alt="Port st willow" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Port-st-willow-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Port-st-willow-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Port-st-willow.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" />#15. Port St. Willow – Syncope</strong><br />
The instrumentation here is sparse and restrained, the falsetto vocal plaintive. Patient percussion, punctuating flutters of guitar and electronics, and the undulating melodies create an atmosphere that reminds me of late-period, post-pop Talk Talk.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Ian William Craig – Cradle for the Wanting</strong><br />
Ian William Craig has spent several albums doggedly refining an unusual recipe – ambient compositions based on varying kinds of manipulation of his trained tenor voice. Cradle for the Wanting is perhaps the purest installment yet, the haunting, wordless vocals dancing with their own sonic decay.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5223" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Chris-Bissonnette-150x150.jpg" alt="Chris Bissonnette" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Chris-Bissonnette-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Chris-Bissonnette-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Chris-Bissonnette.jpg 745w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" />#17. Christopher Bissonnette &#8211; Pitch, Paper &amp; Foil</strong><br />
Very much in continuity with last year’s Essays in Idleness, this album continues Bissonnette’s move away from his earlier ambient palette and into his engagement with quavering synth soliloquies. I am left feeling as if it is less a matter of playing music on the synth and more of coaxing the synth into speech, drawing forth a fragile voice from it that sings in its own expressive tongue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5231" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Irisarri-150x150.jpg" alt="Irisarri" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Irisarri-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Irisarri.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" />#18. Rafael Anton Irisarri &#8211; A Fragile Geography</strong><br />
Irisarri’s work is consistently worth listening to, and here as always he achieves a depth of texture and grandness of gesture that lend tremendous weight and presence to his dronescapes. Another important release to add to his growing oeuvre.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5221" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Alva-Noto-150x150.jpg" alt="Alva Noto" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Alva-Noto-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Alva-Noto-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Alva-Noto.jpg 583w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" />#19. Alva Noto &#8211; Xerrox Vol 3</strong><br />
Xerrox Vol 2 is an album that I admire greatly, and there was a 6-year wait for its successor; I think my ears were therefore too primed for something similar. Xerrox 3 is more sparse and subdued and yet also more overtly emotive. Like all of Carsten Nicolai’s work it exudes precision and care. I suspect it will continue to grow on me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Fabio Biondi &#8211; Vivaldi: I concerti dell&#8217;addio</strong><br />
I ended up listening to a lot of Vivaldi this year after learning that his music didn’t have to be played like the Vivaldi I grew up hearing. Fabio Biondi’s versions of Vivaldi are always vibrant, and this new collection has rich texture and the accustomed verve.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I confess to being a skeptic regarding best-of-year lists, though I suspect I am far from alone. The general arbitrariness of the exercise (my own list might look different if you asked me in a different week*) combines with inevitable comparison of apples and oranges (is it really possible to say that a given ambient release is slightly &#8220;better&#8221; than a given rock album?). What&#8217;s more, I usually fail to find my own listening reflected in most published lists (this year I trawled several prominent top 50 and top 100 lists and found almost zero overlap with my own personal list). Adding another may well be simply adding to the futility.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to go ahead though, largely because of the small chance that as a result someone might discover one of the titles listed below and come to love it. After all, I discovered several of them through the gratefully received recommendations of others. Moreover, each of these releases deserves to be noted on a list somewhere. I make no claim to judge cosmic significance, attribute enduring worth, or arbitrate taste. The following albums are simply 2011 releases that I&#8217;ve played many times each and that have left me delighted or fascinated and wanting to keep hearing them in 2012.</p>
<p>[*Addendum &#8211; as if purposely to prove this correct, two days after posting this list I discovered the album <a href="http://www.emusic.com/listen/#/album/farewell-poetry/hoping-for-the-invisible-to-ignite/12792119/:" title="Farewell Poetry" target="_blank">Hoping for the Invisible to Ignite</a> by <a href="http://www.farewell-poetry.com/" title="FareWell Poetry homepage" target="_blank">FareWell Poetry</a>; had I heard it a week earlier it would have made my top five.]</p>
<p><img class="alignleft" title="The Door in the Wall" src="http://f0.bcbits.com/z/14/40/1440439739-1.jpg" alt="" width="110" height="110" /><span id="more-1057"></span><br />
<strong>#20 Offthesky &#8211; <em>The Door in the Wall</em></strong><br />
Part of the intriguing <a title="Wist Rec Book Report Series" href="http://wistrec.com/the-book-report-ethos/" target="_blank">Book Report Series</a> by Wist Rec, in which musical interpretations of literary works are packaged with the relevant book, this 3&#8243; release offers a compelling musical reading of a short story by H. G. Wells (full review <a title="The Door in the Wall" href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//2011/11/the-door-in-the-wall/" target="_blank">here</a>). Offthesky&#8217;s full-length release <em>The Beautiful Nowhere</em> was another candidate for this list, but the added interest of music interpreting text and the story deepening the music lends extra weight to this excellent little electronic tone poem.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft" title="Meridians" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41IPgh%2BM0-L._SL500_SS110_.jpg" alt="" width="110" height="110" /><br />
<strong>#19 David Wenngren &amp; Christopher Bissonnette &#8211; <em>The Meridians of Longitude and Parallels of Latitude</em></strong><br />
This is simply an exceptionally fine ambient/drone release. Its aural textures are complex and interesting throughout, accented with subtle small sounds. As its grainy landscape ebbs and flows, it holds the attention from start to finish, sensitively balancing mood and forward motion. This is one that I will be returning to often.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft" title="Glimmer" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Wniw%2B7B4L._SL500_SS110_.jpg" alt="" width="110" height="110" /><br />
<strong>#18 Jacaszek &#8211; <em>Glimmer</em></strong><br />
Unashamedly pretty classical motifs emerge from a veil of grainy electronic murmurings, creating an ongoing tension between bright, disciplined clarity and gauzy, undulating currents and eddies of distortion. The effect is like hearing snatches of classical music through a window while standing on an incessantly rolling, creaking boat in the fog. An admirable restraint gives the whole a sense of delicacy.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft" title="La Lechuza" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61gbOFQCCOL._SL500_SS110_.jpg" alt="" width="110" height="110" /><br />
<strong>#17 Esmerine &#8211; <em>La Lechuza</em></strong><br />
The sophomore release from Esmerine (formed by members of GYBE and Silver Mt. Zion), <em>La Lechuza</em>, is more accessible, relaxed, and complex than the band&#8217;s debut and expands their musical palette. It moves from sparkling rhythmic patterns in which marimba and strings dynamically intertwine to poetic, softly yearning songs, with cello, harp and saxophone adding to the rich tones.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft" title="Tassili" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51DkEX1mvqL._SL500_SS110_.jpg" alt="" width="110" height="110" /><br />
<strong>#16 Tinariwen &#8211; <em>Tassili</em></strong><br />
I know folk who prefer their earlier albums, but to my ears the laid-back acoustic sound of <em>Tassili</em> is captivating. The sinuous, swaying rhythms and earthy vocals soon get under the skin, offering the sense of joining a campfire singalong in an unknown language. The lyrics are worth reading in translation also, weaving poetic tales of desert life.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft" title="The Long Surrender" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51bjosc6caL._SL500_SS110_.jpg" alt="" width="110" height="110" /><br />
<strong>#15 Over the Rhine &#8211; <em>The Long Surrender</em></strong><br />
<em>The Long Surrender</em> is my favorite Over the Rhine album of their last several releases. It contains the usual collection of memorable, thoughtful songs, wryly insightful lyrics, great vocals and understated accompaniment. It moved up on to this list in large measure because of &#8216;Infamous Love Song&#8217;, a magnificent return to the dramatically verbose poetry of early Over the Rhine material.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft" title="Hotel Monterey" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/4176xzu2m9L._SL500_SS110_.jpg" alt="" width="110" height="110" /><br />
<strong>#14 Minizza &#8211; <em>Hotel Monterey</em></strong><br />
A single 50+ minute piece of experimentation that begins with found sounds, moves through a variety of atmospheres and sound effects, and ends in blissful strumming, this album impresses with its constant shifts of sound, a surprise around every corner. This enables it to capture the attention more consistently than your average drone/environmental marathon. Don&#8217;t expect songs or tunes, but do expect an absorbing listen if you have the patience to tackle it.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft" title="Double Handsome Dragons" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/510xm1xo7bL._SL500_SS110_.jpg" alt="" width="110" height="110" /><br />
<strong>#13 Double Handsome Dragons &#8211; <em>Double Handsome Dragons</em></strong><br />
This one requires no patience at all. It is here not because it&#8217;s great art, but because it&#8217;s great fun. Boundless energy, an everything-plus-the-kitchen-sink approach to composition, and a collection of at times hilarious science fiction movie samples are stirred together into a manic and gleeful instrumental rock record that makes me want to move and always makes me smile.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft" title="Song of the Sibyl" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61OQ742NmHL._SL500_SS110_.jpg" alt="" width="110" height="110" /><br />
<strong>#12 Jordi Savall and Montserrat Figueras &#8211; <em>The Song of the Sibyl </em></strong><br />
I don&#8217;t buy very many classical recordings, and even less Christmas music, but this is gorgeous. Three versions of a liturgical chant performed in Mallorcan churches since the Middle Ages soar with timeless beauty. The singing is fine, and the instrumentation atmospheric. As my daughter put it, this is &#8220;epic&#8221;.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft" title="Recollage" src="http://luxusarctica.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/luxxar052001-01_150x150.jpg" alt="" width="110" height="110" /><br />
<strong>#11 Erik Nilsson &#8211; <em>Recollage</em></strong><br />
A <a title="Recollage" href="http://luxusarctica.wordpress.com/2011/01/17/recollage/" target="_blank">free download</a> from the Luxus-Arctica label, this release by Erik Nilsson delights at every turn. Cut up fragments of acoustic instruments, beats, and environmental sounds are painstakingly combined into an unfailingly tuneful and entertaining whole that transcends its techniques through sheer musicality. Perhaps the year&#8217;s best free release.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft" title="Dropped Pianos" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41QFjL8OsZL._SL500_SS110_.jpg" alt="" width="110" height="110" /><br />
<strong>#10 Tim Hecker &#8211; <em>Dropped Pianos</em></strong><br />
Tim Hecker&#8217;s <em>Ravedeath, 1972</em> earned a mention on many end of year lists; personally, I preferred the less heralded companion release. Presented as a series of sketches and outtakes from the <em>Ravedeath</em> album, it keeps the underlying piano recordings closer to the surface and offers a more sonorous, mysterious, and oddly melodic sound world than the finished manipulations of <em>Ravedeath</em>.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft" title="Or" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41QtL1rgUCL._SL500_SS110_.jpg" alt="" width="110" height="110" /><br />
<strong>#9 Kangding Ray &#8211; <em>Or</em></strong><br />
On this release Kangding Ray takes the stern, minimalist approach approach to techno characteristic of raster-noton stalwarts Alva Noto and Olaf Bender, defrosts it somewhat, and adds vocals and an overarching concept (<em>Or</em> is both the French word for gold and an English word denoting choice). The whole has a warmer sonic atmosphere than is typical for the genre. Great driving music.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft" title="Plains of the Purple Buffalo" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51klCKGVd0L._SL500_SS110_.jpg" alt="" width="110" height="110" /><br />
<strong>#8 *Shels &#8211;<em> Plains of the Purple Buffalo</em></strong><br />
The second album from *shels takes elements of post-rock and post-metal, blends in a few other musical accents, adds ecstatic, mostly wordless vocals and expansive melodies, and produces from the mix a joyous suite of songs that sway back and forth from the quiet and pretty to the soaring and grandiose. Listened to from start to finish it offers a sweeping journey that communicates joy in making music.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft" title="Univrs" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31q2gxM9CfL._SL500_SS110_.jpg" alt="" width="110" height="110" /><br />
<strong>#7 Alva Noto &#8211; <em>Univrs</em></strong><br />
The latest installment from the more club-oriented side of Carsten Nicolai&#8217;s musical psyche, <em>Univrs</em> (full review <a title="Alva Noto’s Univrs – Almost Human" href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//2011/11/alva-notos-univrs-almost-human/" target="_blank">here</a>) offers up more of the jagged, cerebral beats already heard on <em>Unitxt</em> and <em>Transform</em>. This release tops its predecessors, however, with a fascinating combination of geometry and motion. Complex and precise rhythms and warm buzzing textures dance elegantly around each other. Minimal techno at its finest.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft" title="The Beauty of Doubting Yourself" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41dh6KtPCdL._SL500_SS110_.jpg" alt="" width="110" height="110" /><br />
<strong>#6 Daniel Thomas Freeman &#8211; <em>The Beauty Of Doubting Yourself</em></strong><br />
This represents a rare and significant achievement: a drone album with a dramatic story arc. The shifting textures, each finely realized, move us from darkness through crisis into light. The album chronicles the artist&#8217;s experience of and emergence from depression; the sparing spoken word samples and track titles cast this as a story of salvation. Rarely has a drone album been so evocatively profound.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft" title="Felt" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31e0D7iJbwL._SL500_SS110_.jpg" alt="" width="110" height="110" /><br />
<strong>#5 Nils Frahm &#8211; <em>Felt</em></strong><br />
A collection of compositions for lightly prepared piano, Nils Frahm&#8217;s <em>Felt</em> combines meditative passages that stretch out and explore the resonance and decay of individual notes with compositions in which flurries of bell-like notes flutter like clouds of butterflies. This is an album that overflows with musicality. It&#8217;s an aural delight from start to finish.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft" title="A Winged Victory for the Sullen" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41U-37w4p6L._SL500_SS110_.jpg" alt="" width="110" height="110" /><br />
<strong>#4 A Winged Victory for the Sullen &#8211; <em>A Winged Victory for the Sullen </em></strong><br />
Bringing together Adam Wiltzie of Stars of the Lid fame and Dustin O&#8217;Halloran (see elsewhere on this list), the debut release by A Winged Victory for the Sullen gracefully occupies a place poised between neo-Romantic piano melodies and ambient drones. Absorbing and emotive, the album offers both moments of wistful melody and some of the richest sonic tapestries of any release this year.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft" title="Shizuku" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41-eyrR9ErL._SL500_SS110_.jpg" alt="" width="110" height="110" /><br />
<strong>#3 Illuha &#8211; <em>Shizuku</em></strong><br />
The 12k label has gone from strength to strength this year, releasing several candidates for this list. <em>Shizuku</em> is something special. In common with a number of recent 12k releases, it emerges from a bed of rustling small sounds used to build a gently shifting landscape in which the attention is drawn more to individual blades of grass and their slight movement relative to one another than to sweeping vistas. To this it adds melodic guitar, cello, and piano motifs, and also some dignified spoken word in Japanese. The results are filled with tender detail and laden with beauty.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft" title="Lumiere" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41Q2TJTZlUL._SL500_SS110_.jpg" alt="" width="110" height="110" /><br />
<strong>#2 Dustin O&#8217;Halloran &#8211; <em>Lumiere</em></strong><br />
On <em>Lumiere</em>, Dustin O&#8217;Halloran takes the simple, inviting piano compositions of his earlier releases and adds texture using electronics and strings. The results find him moving in similar territory to Max Richter or Ólafur Arnalds, creating luminous post-electronic chamber music. Tender and inviting, the brief compositions work fine as background music but also offer beauty enough for contemplation if made the center of attention.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft" title="Owl Splinters" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41NhNa7VCbL._SL500_SS110_.jpg" alt="" width="110" height="110" /><br />
<strong>#1 Deaf Center &#8211; <em>Owl Splinters</em></strong><br />
I&#8217;ve greatly appreciated the material released by Erik Skodvin and Otto Totland under a variety of names, and this year&#8217;s new release by Deaf Center is magnificent. Deeply resonant drones and the groan of distressed strings create atmospheres filled with brooding portent, and are interrupted by petite piano passages of fragile, crystalline beauty. Listening to the album is like walking through a dark, forbidding forest and happening across small clearings where springs are illuminated by thin, pure shafts of light. The attention to detail throughout is impressive &#8211; not a sound seems placed other than where it needs to be. There are some very dark passages, but in the end the light, delicate and vulnerable, wins out.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“People were more interested back then than today in this serious electronic music” comments former Kraftwerk member Klaus Röder in an interview for the recent documentary film <em>Kraftwerk and the Electronic Revolution</em>. “Yes, people today are interested in techno and so on, but I’ve had the feeling…that no one knows that it exists, the serious or so-called serious electronic music.” He may have a point – I’m guessing that most of the crowds at Germany&#8217;s famous &#8220;Love Parade&#8221; were not thinking “Ah, Stockhausen!” when they geared up to party. But the opposition of “techno” and “serious” is a little too easy. Alva Noto (the main recording alias of German electronic artist Carsten Nicolai) is one of the more significant reasons why.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span id="more-59"></span><img class="aligncenter" src="http://images.emusic.com/music/images/album/281/128/333/12833361/300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></p>

</dl>
</div>
<p>Noto/Nicolai has just released a new album, <em><a title="Univrs" href="http://www.raster-noton.net/main.php?action=newsdetail&#038;dat=279" target="_blank">Univrs</a> </em>(raster-noton, 2011), offering the latest (and arguably best) installment of his immediately recognizable brand of jagged, minimalist, surgically precise techno music. It’s serious stuff, in several senses of the word. It’s terribly earnest – “playful” is hardly an adjective that comes to mind in connection with an Alva Noto disc. His work carries the palpable sense of each sine wave and particle having been painstakingly and dispassionately fixed in place. It demands focused attention, working not with hooks but with complexity and crystalline structure. It’s highbrow – Nicolai references particle physics as an inspiration and <a title="Tiny Mix Tapes review of Univrs" href="http://www.tinymixtapes.com/music-review/alva-noto-univrs" target="_blank">reviewers</a> are impelled to wax lyrical on the generative role of data in a technological society. The kind of serious that interests me here though, has to do with whether Nicolai&#8217;s work is saying something worth attending to. And to get at that, I suggest looking back a couple of years before the present release to a 2009 short film that Nicolai made to accompany a track from <em>Univrs</em>’s predecessor, <em>Unitxt </em>(raster-noton, 2008).</p>
<iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/5iABNDvZ8IA?version=3&amp;wmode=transparent" width="560" height="340" title="YouTube video player" style="background-color:#000;display:block;margin-bottom:0;max-width:100%;" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="font-size:11px;margin-top:0;"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iABNDvZ8IA" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube">Watch this video on YouTube</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iABNDvZ8IA">Carsten Nicolai &#8211; future past perfect (You Tube)</a></p>
<p>The plot is simple: a man approaches a vending machine in Tokyo and tries to buy a drink. The machine is at first unresponsive, then takes on a mind of its own and plays harsh minimalist techno at him for a while as lights flash and a voice recites (in French!) the string of numbers that appear on the machine and in various parts of the surroundings. Eventually it grinds to a halt in a squall of static, he is rewarded with his bottle of whatever, and he drives off. Like the music, the film is a precise arrangement of a small number of simple elements. In combination, however, they begin to suggest wider connections.</p>
<p>An obvious connection is with Kraftwerk, the godfathers of electronic pop music in Germany and beyond. Their 1981 album <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWSkwvvfmco" target="_blank"><em>Computerwelt</em> (Computer World)</a> included the track <em><a title="Kraftwerk - Numbers (You Tube)" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YPiCeLwh5o" target="_blank">Nummern</a></em> (Numbers), which consisted of electronically manipulated voices reciting sequences of numbers in various languages (including French) over a strident digital beat. The larger context on that album was commentary on the rise of computers and their increasing societal influence (“Interpol and Deutsche Bank, FBI and Scotland Yard/Business, Numbers, Money, People/Computer World”). Kraftwerk didn’t sound overly worried about the trend – they knew that computers could be fun – but the serene humor was married to a serious theme: the relationship between computers, numbers, and people. Carsten Nicolai’s film updates the theme in a perturbing way. The human protagonist stands mute and agape, his eyes twitching in time to the digital rhythms spat at him not by some massive mainframe at Interpol or some more recent high-tech CIA surveillance system, but by a vending machine in a side street. The machine makes the rhythms, the human just reacts, and what it takes to elicit Pavlovian obedience is not some vast international conspiracy, just the bright colors, flashing lights, and synthetic tastes of everyday consumption. Our hero seems to lack any curiosity about why the vending machine might have come to life and played him music and numbers; when it stops, he gets his bottle of colored water, and that seems to be enough for him to walk dumbly away and head for home. Nicolai presents his film as having arisen from his interest in &#8220;automation&#8221; – watching it, one wonders which party to the exchange is the more automated.</p>
<p>Hans Magnus Enzensberger, generally and justly regarded as Germany&#8217;s most important living poet, also comes to mind. He <a title="Die Furie des Verschwindens (Amazon.de)" href="http://www.amazon.de/Die-Furie-Verschwindens-Gedichte-suhrkamp/dp/3518110667/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&#038;qid=1321225066&#038;sr=8-3" target="_blank">published</a> a poem in 1980 titled <em>Automat</em> – in English, <em>Vending Machine</em>. It pictures a man feeding coins into a vending machine and pulling out cigarettes, cancer, apartheid. The action is repeated, compulsive, he keeps coming for more as he consumes what he&#8217;s purchased – the promised contentment keeps disappearing and he has to return. &#8220;He looks at the vending machine,&#8221; Enzensberger writes, &#8220;he sees himself/for a moment/he looks like a human being/then he disappears again.&#8221; A man looking at his image in the glass of a vending machine. His behavior is mechanical, choreographed by the machine&#8217;s designer and the product&#8217;s makers and marketers. Like the products, he too is there for a moment and disappears. The grass withers and the flowers fade. In the mean time, which is directing the show, man or machine? Has the man become a consumable, entirely replaceable when he &#8220;lies buried&#8221; under what he has consumed?</p>
<p>It might seem as if we&#8217;re drifting away from the music here, but not necessarily, for the music itself hints at similar themes. Carsten Nicolai <a title="Carsten Nicolai interview (ATTN magazine)" href="http://www.attnmagazine.co.uk/feature/4768" target="_blank">has described</a> the music on <em>Unitxt</em> and <em>Univrs</em> as &#8220;experimental club music&#8221;, and <em>Unitxt</em> stuck close to standard dance tempos. The dominant sounds on <em>Unitxt</em> were built from manipulated recordings of machine noises – fax machines, modems, telephones. The grotesque image floats into view of crowds of people, looking like human beings, dancing rhythmically, mechanically to the insistent beat of their office machinery. One track has poet Anne-James Chaton (the voice behind the numbers) recite the contents of Nicolai&#8217;s wallet in a monotone as the beat pounds forward &#8211; is this tantamount to displaying his identity? The 2009 film shows us a man&#8217;s eyes twitching in mute, rhythmic response to a vending machine that seems to have gained the upper hand in the encounter. The film&#8217;s title, <em>future past perfect,</em> like much of Kraftwerk&#8217;s work, leaves us poised delicately between futurism and nostalgia. This techno, it turns out, may have something to say. <em>Wir sind die Roboter</em> indeed.</p>
<p>So has Nicolai reduced electronic dance music to a cold commentary on the programmability of people, a dispassionate dissection of the subjection of the listening self and its illusions of personhood to the laws of physics? He&#8217;s certainly deeply interested in the physics of perception and the effects of sounds on human listeners; but perhaps there are other ways to listen. On <em>Univrs</em>, the new album, the beats are more diverse (with characteristically gratuitous precision <a title="Carsten Nicolai interview (ATTN magazine)" href="http://www.attnmagazine.co.uk/feature/4768" target="_blank">he notes</a> that one of the tracks runs at 133.333 bpm) and the textures a shade warmer here and there (a little less screeching, a little more low-end rumble). I can&#8217;t say how it works on the dance floor, but on headphones it seems to me less a stupefying than an absorbing listen as he builds complex edifices of precisely contrasted sounds and prods them into stuttering motion. Techno this may be, but it is not music that dulls reflection. Perhaps instead it can invite the kind of wonder evoked by crystals and rock formations – impersonal, yes, but also small revelations of the potential intricacy of the world of sound, itself one more part of the wonders of creation. There is even a nod to individual creativity &#8211; the new album offers a fresh example of Chaton&#8217;s minimalist recitations, this time a string of acronyms. Nicolai has <a title="Carsten Nicolai interview (ATTN magazine)" href="http://www.attnmagazine.co.uk/feature/4768" target="_blank">commented</a> that since few will recognize all of them, each listener will connect the ones they recognize in different patterns, creating different implied narratives. To a greater degree than<em> Unitxt</em>, the music of <em>Univrs</em> seems to invite not so much involuntary twitching as a more human kind of involvement &#8211; attentiveness, appreciation for what has been so carefully and exactingly wrought, and creative appropriation. It&#8217;s still all data, yes, but it&#8217;s data that exhibits a kind of beauty. And ironically, of the various albums that I&#8217;ve spent time with in the last couple of months, it&#8217;s this dose of minimalist techno that has most caused me to think. Serious music indeed.</p>
