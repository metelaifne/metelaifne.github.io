				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Can it be a year since the last list? Here goes with my favorite 20 releases of 2017. Your tastes are not mine, you will disagree, but maybe there is something here that you might not have discovered, something of beauty that might bring you joy. At one point I thought this might be a thin year; when I got down to making the list I realized there was no filler at the bottom. Exact placement is fuzzy – there are lots of apples and oranges being compared here. Feel free to move any of these up or down a few places in your head.</p>
<p><a href="https://12kmusic.bandcamp.com/album/somi"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5412" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/top-20-of-2017-david-smith/Somi-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="200" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/top-20-of-2017-david-smith/Somi-300x300.jpg 300w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/top-20-of-2017-david-smith/Somi-150x150.jpg 150w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/top-20-of-2017-david-smith/Somi.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" /></a><strong>#1. Taylor Deupree – Somi</strong></p>
<p>Deupree’s <em>Faint</em> from a few years ago is still one of my regular listens and pleasures, and I wonder with hindsight if I should have placed it at number one that year. He gave me another chance with the magnificent, meditative <em>Somi</em>. Loops of single notes from acoustic instruments played at varying intervals are layered and treated to create a fascinating slow dance of beauty and rest. And the deluxe edition packaging was as gorgeous as the music. (<a href="https://12kmusic.bandcamp.com/album/somi">Listen</a>)</p>

<p><strong>#2. Daniel Herskedal – The Roc</strong></p>
<p>Norwegian tubaist Herskedal’s new album adds an Arabic influence to his tuba-based jazz-folk explorations. The result is a unique, at times magical set of tunes high in atmosphere and richly colored. Several parts of this album stayed in my head all year. (<a href="https://danielherskedal.bandcamp.com/album/the-roc">Listen</a>)</p>

<p><a href="https://dronarivm.bandcamp.com/album/avifaunal"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5429" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/top-20-of-2017-david-smith/Pausal-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/top-20-of-2017-david-smith/Pausal-150x150.jpg 150w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/top-20-of-2017-david-smith/Pausal-300x300.jpg 300w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/top-20-of-2017-david-smith/Pausal-768x768.jpg 768w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/top-20-of-2017-david-smith/Pausal-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/top-20-of-2017-david-smith/Pausal.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>#3. Pausal – Avifaunal</strong></p>
<p>Pausal’s warm and finely textured drones have been growing on me the last few years. This year’s release took things up a notch, with a sweeping grandeur and narrative flow that make each minute count. An album to get lost in. (<a href="https://dronarivm.bandcamp.com/album/avifaunal">Listen</a>)</p>

<p><strong>#4. Anat Cohen Tentet – Happy Song</strong></p>
<p>The title and bright yellow cover are apt. New York-based Israeli clarinetist Cohen and her ensemble deliver a vibrantly grooving set of jazz romps that shift in character as the album progresses while maintaining an infectious sense of joy. (<a href="http://anzicstore.com/album/happy-song">Listen</a>)</p>

<p><strong>#5. Tinariwen – Elwan</strong></p>
<p>The Saharan blues return with the latest from the great Tuareg band, and it’s one of their finest. The sinuous, swaying rhythms undergird starkly poetic laments at the loss of social and environmental fabric.

<p><strong>#6. Seldom Sene Recorder Consort – Goldberg Variations</strong></p>
<p>As the title gives away, this is the Goldberg Variations played on recorders by a Dutch recorder consort. In addition to the virtuoso playing, the different sonorities of the wind instruments made the Goldbergs sparkle for me in a gentle and delightful new way.

<p><strong>#7. Otto A. Totland – The Lost</strong></p>
<p>Very similar in spirit to its predecessor, <em>Pinô</em>, this second album of piano solos again showcases Norwegian pianist Otto Totland’s ability to conjure a gentle, plaintive warmth through small melodies and soft sounds. (<a href="https://ottoatotland.bandcamp.com/">Listen</a>)</p>

<p><a href="https://chiheihatakeyama.bandcamp.com/album/sora"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5413" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/top-20-of-2017-david-smith/Sora-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/top-20-of-2017-david-smith/Sora-150x150.jpg 150w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/top-20-of-2017-david-smith/Sora-300x300.jpg 300w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/top-20-of-2017-david-smith/Sora-768x768.jpg 768w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/top-20-of-2017-david-smith/Sora-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/top-20-of-2017-david-smith/Sora.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>#8. Chihei Hatakeyama &amp; Federico Durand – Sora</strong></p>
<p>Combining Hatakeyama’s characteristic gossamer tonal washes and Durand’s delightfully pattering small sounds is a recipe for enormous prettiness, and that is just what we get on this deeply calming album. (<a href="https://chiheihatakeyama.bandcamp.com/album/sora">Listen</a>)</p>

<p><strong>#9. The Green Kingdom – The North Wind and the Sun</strong></p>
<p>The Green Kingdom has issued a long series of recordings offering an attractive world of delicate small sounds and textures. This release feels like something fresh as it bursts forth into uplifting melody thanks to the foregrounded guitar work.

<p><strong>#10. Emile Parisien, Vincent Peirani, Andreas Schaerer &amp; Michael Wollny – Out of Land</strong></p>
<p>An unusual but top-notch European jazz combo consisting of sax, accordion, piano, and vocalizations/beatboxing. The live recordings prickle with energy and abound in creativity, making for an exciting listen. (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAKio4qfeqM">Watch</a>)</p>

<p><strong>#11. Fieldhead – We’ve All Been Swimming</strong></p>
<p>Fieldhead’s latest is by far my favorite by the artist so far. It plays with odd rhythmic combinations, layering looping synth melodies over divergent rhythms. The result is a kind of mellow fascination, and great fun. (<a href="https://homeassemblymusic.bandcamp.com/album/weve-all-been-swimming">Listen</a>)</p>

<p><strong>#12. Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark – The Punishment of Luxury</strong></p>
<p>Not much pop makes my lists, but I loved OMD as a teen, and this new release sounds as if it could have been the immediate follow up to 1983’s <em>Dazzle Ships</em>. It nails what made their original Kraftwerk-with-soul sound special, and that made me grin. (<a href="https://officialomd.bandcamp.com/releases">Listen</a>)</p>

<p><strong>#13. Rudresh Mahanthappa/Indo-Pak Coalition – Agrima </strong></p>

<p><strong>#14. Helge Lien Trio – Guzuguzu</strong></p>
<p>With track titles drawn from Japanese onomatopoeia, Helge Lien’s latest piano trio album is made up of moody evocations of atmosphere and movement, often skirting around song structures. Sparkling piano breaks through like rays of sunlight. (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u8uNWIroJQ">Watch</a>)</p>

<p><strong>#15. Porya Hatami – Monads</strong></p>
<p>When I posted my review of this to Facebook none of my friends hit “like,” and it is admittedly a pretty abstract set of experiments with sound rather than a collection of tunes. But they are fascinating experiments, glimpses into the push-and-pull of forces that make the world a place with sound.

<p><strong>#16. Yazz Ahmed – La Saboteuse</strong></p>
<p>Ahmed is a British-Bahraini trumpeter who here successfully melds Arabic motifs, electronic treatments, and jazz trumpet in a set of beguiling tunes. (<a href="https://yazzahmed.bandcamp.com/album/la-saboteuse-2">Listen</a>)</p>

<p><strong>#17. Alea Saxophone Quartet – Arvo Pärt: Anima</strong></p>
<p>If the idea of Pärt played on saxophones conjures up a mental collision of ethereal voices and ill-chosen skronking, think again. The pure tones and harmonies of the sax quartet evocatively capture the spirit of Pärt’s austere choral pieces.

<p><strong>#18. Taylor Deupree &amp; Marcus Fischer – Lowlands</strong></p>
<p>Building on previous outings as a duo, Deupree and Fischer again show a mastery of the microscopic world of small resonances, adding another delightful release to their growing oeuvre. (<a href="https://12kmusic.bandcamp.com/album/lowlands">Listen</a>)</p>

<p><strong>#19. Brot &amp; Sterne – Tales of Herbst</strong></p>
<p>This was not quite like anything else I listened to, which is perhaps not surprising in the case of a hurdy-gurdy/hang drum/trumpet jazz trio. The improvised instrumentals set warmly tuneful passages amid unique and atmospheric textures. (<a href="https://brotundsterne.bandcamp.com/releases">Listen</a>)</p>

<p><strong>#20. Billow Observatory – II: Plains/Patterns </strong></p>
<p>More active than their debut release, this collection of ambient pieces pulses and shimmers airily. Enjoyable throughout. (<a href="https://billowobservatory.bandcamp.com/album/ii-plains-patterns">Listen</a>)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The next 10&#8230;</strong></p>
<p>And here are ten more that I had a really hard time cutting to get the list down to 20. Some of these jumped in and out of my list several times, and might have made it if I had finalized the list tomorrow. Alphabetically:</p>
<p>Wil Bolton – Night Paths (Ambient)</p>
<p>Bruce Cockburn – Bone on Bone (Folk)</p>
<p>Marcus Fischer – Loss (Ambient)</p>
<p>From the Mouth of the Sun – Hymn Binding (Modern Classical)</p>
<p>Ian Hawgood &amp; Wil Bolton – Transparencies (Ambient)</p>
<p>Hudson – Hudson (Jazz)</p>
<p>Rafael Anton Irisarri – The Shameless Years (Ambient)</p>
<p>Benedikt Jahnel Trio – The Invariant (Piano jazz)</p>
<p>Darren McClure – Nature Mirror (Ambient)</p>
<p>Phronesis, Julian Argüelles, &amp; Frankfurt Radio Big Band – The Behemoth (Jazz)</p>
<p>As ever, if any of the artists happen by, thank you for another year of inspiring music.</p>

<p>Swede Kristian Matsson has been making singer/songwriter folk as The Tallest Man on Earth since 2006, but <em>Dark Bird is Home</em> is easily his grandest.  Featuring a full band for the first time, including horns and even some electronics, Matsson has added a richness and depth to his music that often puts the album more in the vein of The Decemberists than his usual comparison of Bon Iver.  His true strength, however, remains as a poet, and the album is chock full of wordplay like &#8220;And I&#8217;ve already grown up here, here I might as well grow down&#8221; (from &#8220;Little Nowhere Towns&#8221;).  This combination of orchestration and lyrics makes <em>Dark Bird is Home</em> an absolute gem.<span id="more-5002"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-may-12-2015/Blanck-Mass-Dumb-Flesh.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5005" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-may-12-2015/Blanck-Mass-Dumb-Flesh.jpg" alt="Blanck Mass - Dumb Flesh" width="280" height="280" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-may-12-2015/Blanck-Mass-Dumb-Flesh.jpg 280w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-may-12-2015/Blanck-Mass-Dumb-Flesh-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 280px) 100vw, 280px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Blanck Mass &#8211; <em>Dumb Flesh</em></strong></p>
<p>A side project of Fuck Buttons&#8217; Benjamin John Power, Blanck Mass makes electronic post rock/drone that is more abstract than Power&#8217;s main group, but fans of Fuck Buttons will continue to find a lot to love on Blanck Mass&#8217; second release.  The album is largely made up of heavy drum machine, synth drones, and electronic chirps and flourishes, with label Sacred Bones <a href="http://www.sacredbonesrecords.com/products/sbr136-blanck-mass-dumb-flesh" target="_blank">describing it</a> as &#8220;a comment on the flaws of the human form in its current evolutionary state.&#8221; That&#8217;s an awful lot to glean from 53 minutes of instrumental experiments, but <em>Dumb Flesh</em> is nonetheless a seriously enjoyable listen even if its meaning is elusive.</p>
<p><a href="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-may-12-2015/Guantanamo-Baywatch-Darling...Its-Too-Late.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5007" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-may-12-2015/Guantanamo-Baywatch-Darling...Its-Too-Late.jpg" alt="Guantanamo Baywatch - Darling...It's Too Late" width="280" height="280" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-may-12-2015/Guantanamo-Baywatch-Darling...Its-Too-Late.jpg 280w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-may-12-2015/Guantanamo-Baywatch-Darling...Its-Too-Late-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 280px) 100vw, 280px" /></a><strong>Guantanamo Baywatch &#8211; <em>Darling&#8230;It&#8217;s Too Late</em></strong></p>
<p>Tacky, trashy, and scuzzy, Guantanamo Baywatch make surf, garage rock inspired by bands like The Trashmen, The Sonics, and The Cramps, and does so for one reason only: It&#8217;s fun.  <em>Darling&#8230;It&#8217;s Too Late</em> is the trio&#8217;s second widely available full length (although there are earlier recordings out there), and takes an &#8220;if it ain&#8217;t broke, don&#8217;t fix it&#8221; mentality to the group&#8217;s formula.  There&#8217;s reverb and lots of tenor on the guitars, vocal harmonies, and a rawness to the music that makes <em>Darling&#8230;It&#8217;s Too Late</em> perfect for hanging out on a summer&#8217;s day.</p>
<p>Also out today: Pfarmers &#8211; <em>Gunnera</em>, Snoop Dogg &#8211; <em>BUSH</em>, and Tyondai Braxton &#8211; <em>HIVE1</em>.</p>

<p>The sophomore release from Toronto noise rock/hardcore punk band Metz, <em>II</em> picks up right where their self titled album left off.  It&#8217;s an Amphetamine Reptile-like mix of punk, grunge, and shoegaze with loud, fuzzed out guitars, crushing drums and bass, and emotive vocals.  Basically <em>II</em> is the epitome of what Robert Christgau derisively calls pigfuck.  As with most bands tarred (gifted?) with that label, however, there&#8217;s a melodicism to Metz that produces a true depth to their sound.  It&#8217;s not music to be played around the campfire, but <em>II</em> is perfect for anyone who likes their rock music with a whole lot of bite.<span id="more-4997"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-may-5-2015/Torres-Sprinter-e1430747969113.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4999" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-may-5-2015/Torres-Sprinter-e1430747969113.jpg" alt="Torres - Sprinter" width="280" height="280" /></a><strong>Torres &#8211; <em>Sprinter</em></strong></p>
<p>Speaking of fuzzy guitars, although this time in a more downtempo folk infused form, Nashville&#8217;s Torres also releases her second album this week.  <em>Sprinter</em> is singer-songwriter music heavily influenced by artists like PJ Harvey and Cat Power, but with a vocal sound reminiscent of Heartless Bastards&#8217; Erika Wennerstrom.  This is an absolutely lovely album, which ends at its most lovely and touching.  &#8220;The Exchange&#8221; is just some <em>very</em> gentle guitar strumming and the sound of birds providing a base for Mackenzie Scott to sing about her adopted mother (who was also adopted), and the feeling of disconnect from your history that comes with being adopted.</p>
<p><a href="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-may-5-2015/My-Morning-Jacket-The-Waterfall.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5000" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-may-5-2015/My-Morning-Jacket-The-Waterfall.jpg" alt="My Morning Jacket - The Waterfall" width="280" height="280" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-may-5-2015/My-Morning-Jacket-The-Waterfall.jpg 280w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-may-5-2015/My-Morning-Jacket-The-Waterfall-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 280px) 100vw, 280px" /></a><strong>My Morning Jacket &#8211; <em>The Waterfall</em></strong></p>
<p>Indie rock, alt country, folk rock, psychedelic&#8230;whatever you want to call it, My Morning Jacket have been developing their sound for more than 15 years now, and <em>The Waterfall</em> is the next step in that evolution.  Bouncing between tracks with funky grooves, synths, and slide guitar (but always featuring Jim James&#8217; rangey voice), <em>The Waterfall</em> fully embraces the best experiments of MMJ&#8217;s last few albums to create what is likely the band&#8217;s best since the celebrated <em>Z</em>.  Lead single &#8220;Big Decisions&#8221; is a standout, but the whole album (especially &#8220;Spring (Among the Living)&#8221;) is perfect for relaxing on a warm summer day.</p>
<p>Also out this week: Best Coast &#8211; <em>California Nights</em>, Mikal Cronin &#8211; <em>MCIII</em>, and Django Django &#8211; <em>Born Under Saturn</em>.</p>

<p>If there were questions as to the direction Sufjan Stevens would take after the departure from the norm that was <em>Age of Adz</em>, naming his new album after his mother and stepfather (his first album since his mother&#8217;s passing, mind you) answered those questions load and clear: Sufjan Stevens is looking back, which means a return to lovely, gentle indie folk.  <em>Carrie &amp; Lowell</em> strips away both the electronics of <em>Adz</em> and the lush orchestration of <em>Come on Feel the Illinoise</em>, putting the focus squarely on Sufjan&#8217;s lyrics, which come heavily from his life.  This album is going inspire a lot of reminiscing, particularly amongst those who have lost parents, and is going to cause a lot of tears.  They&#8217;ll be happy tears, though, so it&#8217;s unlikely people will be complaining. <span id="more-4962"></span></p>

Black Emperor &#8211; <em>Asunder, Sweet and Other Distress</em></strong></p>
<p>Somewhere along the way, Godspeed You! Black Emperor&#8217;s post rock dropped its found sounds and more lighthearted moments, veering strongly to the drone end of the genre&#8217;s spectrum.  <em>Asunder, Sweet and Other Distress</em> continues the band&#8217;s exploration of that side of post rock.  The album is throbbing, foreboding, and everything you expect from GY!BE, but there is a surprising amount of light in these drones.  This is not an album that pummels you into submission through builds to overwhelming climaxes, rather it invites the listener to immerse themselves in the quieter moments with an almost hopeful feel that leaves the listener feeling legitimately joyful.</p>
<p><a href="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-march-31-2015/Lower-Dens-Escape-From-Evil.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4964" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-march-31-2015/Lower-Dens-Escape-From-Evil.jpg" alt="Lower Dens - Escape From Evil" width="280" height="280" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-march-31-2015/Lower-Dens-Escape-From-Evil.jpg 280w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-march-31-2015/Lower-Dens-Escape-From-Evil-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 280px) 100vw, 280px" /></a><strong>Lower Dens &#8211; <em>Escape From Evil</em></strong></p>
<p>Baltimore&#8217;s Lower Dens are a band on the rise.  In 2012 they released the excellent <em>Nootropics</em>, an album heavily indebted to shoegaze/dream pop sounds that would have fit in well on 4AD.  With <em>Escape From Evil</em>, however, they&#8217;re introducing a dancey, new wave feel to their music.  Drums and bass drive the songs on <em>Escape From Evil</em> and give the album a bounce that just hasn&#8217;t existed for the band before. Even with the new direction, however, the band&#8217;s music rises and falls with Jana Hunter&#8217;s strong alto vocals (reminiscent of Baltimore cohort Victoria Legrand of Beach House), and on this album there is far more rise than fall.</p>

<p>Much to the surprise of everyone (including his management at TDE), King Kendrick&#8217;s new album is out in the world a week early.  There is a lot that can, will, and should be said about <em>To Pimp a Butterfly</em>, but it all boils down to one thing: This album is an absolute monster.  <em>To Pimp a Butterfly</em> is essentially (and on &#8220;Mortal Man&#8221;, literally) a funked up conversation between Kendrick and his fore bearers.  It is also a simultaneous declaration of being a proud black man and a declaration of war against the socio-economic situation so many face in American society.  It&#8217;s the most daringly political album in some time, and it is jawdroppingly amazing.<span id="more-4950"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-march-17-2015/Tobias-Jesso-Jr.-Goon.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4952" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-march-17-2015/Tobias-Jesso-Jr.-Goon.jpg" alt="Tobias Jesso, Jr. - Goon" width="280" height="280" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-march-17-2015/Tobias-Jesso-Jr.-Goon.jpg 280w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-march-17-2015/Tobias-Jesso-Jr.-Goon-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 280px) 100vw, 280px" /></a><strong>Tobias Jesso, Jr. &#8211; <em>Goon</em></strong></p>
<p>&#8217;70s style singer/songwriters are back in a big way, and along with Father John Misty, Tobias Jesso, Jr. stands above the crowd.  A failed songwriter turned successful artist thanks to YouTube, Jesso&#8217;s music is made up of gentle pianos, finger-picked guitars, soulful vocals, and occasional strings.  On <em>Goon</em>, he creates an absolutely lovely album that is very of the moment and will feature on many 2015 lists.</p>
<p><a href="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-march-17-2015/Twin-Shadow-Eclipse.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4953" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-march-17-2015/Twin-Shadow-Eclipse.jpg" alt="Twin Shadow - Eclipse" width="280" height="280" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-march-17-2015/Twin-Shadow-Eclipse.jpg 280w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-march-17-2015/Twin-Shadow-Eclipse-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 280px) 100vw, 280px" /></a><strong>Twin Shadow &#8211; <em>Eclipse</em></strong></p>
<p>George Lewis is a bit of an iconoclast in the New York City music scene.  While many of his contemporaries are limiting their label involvement (if not ditching the label system completely) he&#8217;s made no secret of his desire to bring his Twin Shadow project to a major label.  With <em>Eclipse</em>&#8216;s release on Warner Bros. Records he&#8217;s achieved this goal with an album full of big, immaculately produced, pop music that isn&#8217;t all that interesting.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8216;Best of&#8217; year-end lists are very subjective, being subject to the individual musical tastes of the compiler and my list, of course, is no different.  Thus, the albums I have named (in no particular order) are simply the newly released ones that I enjoyed listening to the most during 2014.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71fdesic4OL._SY450_.jpg" alt="" width="241" height="241" /></p>
<p><strong><em>Love and Gravity</em> &#8211; Mary Fahl</strong>:  This newest album by Mary Fahl recalls the glory days of her now defunct group October Project and excels them.  Fahl&#8217;s rich contralto voice sounds as good as ever with no fillers here. Each track is a treasure, but a few standouts warrant special mention.  It is hard to imagine a siren more spellbinding than in the song, &#8220;Siren,&#8221; and Fahl&#8217;s cover of &#8220;Both Sides Now&#8221; sounds like the song was written especially for her, infusing it with a deep emotional introspection I never appreciated before (not to take away from Collins’ timeless original). Then there is the beautiful memorial, &#8220;The Dawning of the Day,&#8221; written for the fallen firefighter heroes of 9/11. This is a stunning album from start to finish.<span id="more-4821"></span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://f1.bcbits.com/img/a1710119280_2.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="250" /></p>
<p><strong><em>Amser </em>&#8211; Fernhill</strong>:  Some years back, reading Eliza Carthy’s unabashed gushing in praise of the new (to me) Welsh folk group, Fernhill, prompted me to listen to the 2000 release, <em>Whilia</em>, and it left me speechless. That album became the standard by which I measure all other Fernhill albums and <em>Amser</em> measures up pretty well.  <em>Whilia&#8217;s</em> lineup consisted of lead singer Julie Murphy accompanied by Ceri Rhys Matthews on guitar and flute, and Andy Cutting&#8217;s prominent (and vital) button accordion.  <em>Amser</em> includes Tomos Williams on trumpet and Christine Cooper on fiddle and vocals.  I found this newest release so gorgeous, I was surprised that it was only after I listened to the whole album that I noticed the absence of the button accordion which I considered essential to the band&#8217;s sound. No matter. This is truly stunning music, segueing from one beautiful melody into another, and another, and then back again that leaves the listener breathless. The song, &#8220;Boat,&#8221; is a particularly good example of this.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/91C7KM%2B6CLL._SX425_.jpg" alt="" width="243" height="243" /></p>
<p><strong><em>Angelorum </em>&#8211; James Apollo</strong>:  This one grabbed me right from the start and kept my attention throughout.  Apparently I&#8217;m not alone. Apollo is steadily gaining attention, having been invited to tour with Lord Huron since <em>Angelorum&#8217;s</em> release.  The album&#8217;s 9 tracks are a mixture of indie rock songs and slower tempo ones and there really isn&#8217;t a dud anywhere and it is a heckuva <em>good</em> indie rock album. Give the track, &#8220;Spinnin&#8221; or &#8220;White Line&#8221; a listen and see for yourself. It has been reported that Leon Russell is currently working with Apollo on a yet untitled 2015 release, and I&#8217;m definitely going to be watching for that!</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/81uOONm%2BEQL._SX425_.jpg" alt="" width="246" height="217" /></p>
<p><em><strong>Last of the Outlaws</strong></em><strong> &#8211; Railroad Earth</strong>:  Railroad Earth is a rootsy Americana newgrass band with folk/roots-rock/celtic leanings who have consistently put out great records since releasing their debut in 2001. Live shows have earned them a reputation as champion of the bluegrass jam for their spontaneous improvisations which have, for the most part, been absent in their studio recordings. <em>Last of the Outlaws</em> changes that. With only 2 of the 10 tracks less than 5 minutes in length, the new album provides plenty of wide open spaces  for the band to romp around and sounds very close to their live performances.  The core and highlight of the album are two back-to-back lengthy songs that together form a 20+ minute opus with segueing sections patterned after movements of the requiem mass that shift from rock guitar licks to whispering piano and everything in between, including horns, string section, and penny whistle.  A true masterpiece.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/81pBJPXP5XL._SY450_.jpg" alt="" width="247" height="247" /></p>
<p><em><strong>A Little Redemption</strong></em><strong> &#8211; Danni Nicholls</strong>:  This album made its debut in the U.K. in 2013 but wasn&#8217;t released in the U.S. until 2014.  Q Magazine describes it as &#8220;slipping effortlessly between smoky soul, folk-pop and heart-wrenching alt-country, all in a rich voice somewhere between Ms [Emmylou] Harris and Alison Krauss.&#8221;  I found Nicholls&#8217; voice somewhat reminiscent of Norah Jones, but whether Jones, Harris or Krauss, Nicholls carves her own niche and is no wannabe.  The opening track, &#8220;First Cuckoo of Spring,&#8221; is one of the many highlights and was featured in the latest season premier episode of Sons of Anarchy, which should give her more very well-deserved U.S. exposure. I look forward to hearing more from her in the future.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/81uw0f3MNwL._SX522_.jpg" alt="" width="264" height="264" /></p>
<p><strong><em>Family</em> &#8211; Thompson</strong>:  The opening track begins with a plaintive Teddy Thompson singing a simple song about family:  &#8220;My father is one of the greatest to ever step on a stage/My mother has the most beautiful voice in the world/And I am betwixt and between/Sean Lennon, you know what I mean/Born to the manor, never quite clamoring free/But it’s family…it’s family.&#8221;  And what a family it is!  Teddy managed to get his estranged parents, legends Richard and Linda Thompson, together (along with a few other extended family members) to help out with his new recording project and the results are impressive. This is not a polished album and it lacks cohesiveness, but the sum of the individual parts makes for such an endearing listen that I found myself coming back to play this one over and over again during the past year.  A most bittersweet, unforgettable and touching recording.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51-Uo-VtEhL.jpg" alt="" width="257" height="257" /></p>
<p><em><strong>Arc Iris</strong></em><strong> &#8211; Arc Iri</strong>s:  &#8220;Arc Iris is the orchestral pop project of Jocie Adams, a former core member of The Low Anthem…The band includes a collective of 4 musicians plus Jocie with additional players frequently joining to expand the sound further to create their wild exploration of all kinds of musical styles &#8211; jazz, prog rock, blues, country, folk, and classical styles.&#8221; So says Amazon&#8217;s editorial review which prompted me to give this album a listen.  Its style is not dissimilar to some of Kate Bush&#8217;s albums.  I found it &#8220;unusual&#8221; and not particularly to my liking at first and intended to quit listening but it soon got its hooks in me and I ended up playing the entire album. What kept me listening were the constant little surprises that keep popping up everywhere (a byproduct of that &#8220;wild exploration&#8221; the Amazon review talked about).  It is completely unconventional and works incredibly well.  By album’s end, I had to admit this is a brilliant recording.  Wonderfully, refreshingly different.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51CBccbFzTL._SS280.jpg" alt="" width="251" height="251" /></p>
<p><strong><em>Still on the Levee</em> &#8211; Chris Smither</strong>:  This is a 2 CD set released to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Smither&#8217;s career and includes newly recorded versions of 25 of his best songs.  Guest musicians include Allen Toussaint, Loudon Wainwright, Kris Delmhorst, and the band Morphine.  I loved this album immediately and it just seems to get better every time I play it.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/91I-fooUcuL._SL1400_.jpg" alt="" width="249" height="249" /></p>
<p><em><strong>So It Is With Us</strong></em><strong> &#8211; Horse Feathers</strong>:  One of the best folk rock albums I&#8217;ve heard in a long while.  I was previously unfamiliar with Horse Feathers, but apparently their previous albums evoke a more pessimistic and sad feeling.  I found the new release generally sounds upbeat.  Apparently it is the group&#8217;s first album that includes percussion, a change that was made at the very brink of bandleader Justin Ringle&#8217;s decision to hang it all up.  The whole album is one big dreamy mellow jam.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61p5r%2BaXNpL._SS280.jpg" alt="" width="252" height="252" /></p>
<p><strong><em>Tracks</em> &#8211; Anne Hills</strong>:  This is an album built around the theme of trains.  I love folk singer, Anne Hills, but an album where every single song is about a train dampened my enthusiasm a little at first, but this is truly one of the outstanding albums of the year. The whole album moves in a very appealing rhythm reminiscent of a rolling train.  I was afraid all the songs would sound alike, but there is much variety including both original compositions and old folk standards. Among the many highlights are a cover of &#8220;City of New Orleans,&#8221; the very humorous &#8220;Train to Morrow&#8221; (which made me laugh out loud), and the gorgeous &#8220;Pullman Porter&#8217;s Christmas.&#8221; Anne says on her website, &#8221; I’m riding the rails that go back in history but also carry me forward … climb on board.” Good advice.  I&#8217;m glad I did.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51H2YHCKG1L._SS280.jpg" alt="" width="259" height="259" /></p>
<p><em><strong>Nothing Can Bring Back the Time</strong></em><strong> &#8211; Josienne Clarke &amp; Ben Walker</strong>:  Tastefully elegant symphonic arrangements are prominent on this beautiful new release. Clarke and Walker continue to wow us with their talents on multiple instruments and Clarke’s heart-skipping lilting voice is, as always, a real show-stopper.  There is a unique version of &#8220;Let No Man Steal Your Thyme&#8221; here which is the best I’ve heard, and the closing &#8220;Water and Wine&#8221; &#8211; a slow, moving song quietly punctuated with piano and sweeping symphonics &#8211;  brings this classy, refined album to a very satisfying close.  Chamber folk doesn’t get any better than this.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71o-G5MPJPL._SX425_.jpg" alt="" width="267" height="246" /></p>
<p><em><strong>Lullaby and&#8230;the Ceaseless Roar</strong></em><strong> &#8211; Robert Plant</strong>:  Plant is back home from America but the musical influences of his days with Krauss and Griffin are still evident even as he continues to push the envelope a little further into new territories.  In this writer’s opinion, this is one of his best efforts yet.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/81E5ZWxfJrL._SX450_.jpg" alt="" width="254" height="228" /></p>
<p><em><strong>When the Deal Goes Down</strong></em> <strong>&#8211; David Olney</strong>:  I&#8217;ve been a die-hard Olney fan for years.  I just don&#8217;t understand how such a talented musician and showman can remain generally under the radar for all these years.  Mainstream has ignored him, although a whole lot of mainstream artists have covered his songs and made huge hits from them.  But if you really want the real deal, give Olney a listen.  I raved about Olney shamelessly in a <a title="David Olney’s Mini-Album Series: Art for the Ears" href="http://musicisgood.org/2012/04/david-olneys-mini-album-series-art-for-the-ears/">previous</a> review, so I won&#8217;t re-hash it all here. Suffice it to say that <em>When the Deal Goes Down</em> is probably the best recording of Olney&#8217;s entire career.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61ELIEfj4AL.jpg" alt="" width="258" height="258" /></p>
<p><em><strong>Vena Portae</strong></em> <strong>– Vena Portae</strong>:  This is the debut album from a side project of Australian singer Emily Barker, who regularly performs with her full time band, The Red Clay Halo.  The side project is a threesome which she describes as a Swedish/Anglo/Aussie collaboration with Swedish producer-engineer-multi-instrumentalist Ruben Engzell, and English theatre maker-songwriter Dom Coyote. Jesper Jonsson, also from Sweden, appears on the record, as well. Emily’s work with The Red Clay Halo has a spark that consistently ignites all their recordings (2013’s <em>Dear River </em>made my desert island list), whereas the music of Vena Portae is necessarily a little more pared down and intimate sounding.  It is lovely, though, and Barker’s vocals are as impressive as ever.  This is a very, very fine debut album.</p>

<p><em><strong>Bela Fleck and Abigail Washburn</strong></em> <strong>&#8211; Bela Fleck and Abigail Washburn</strong>:  A full album of nothing but two people playing banjos and some vocals might raise some serious skepticism in many listeners, but those who take the plunge anyway will be surprised to find that this recording sounds like a whole lot more. This is achieved by the use of seven different kinds of banjos, ranging from small ukulele types to larger baritone banjos that help serve as a bass line.  Fleck and Washburn ingenuously bring in various influences including blues, African beats, old-time folk, and even an adaptation of a Béla Bartok classical composition.  The album is much more than what might be expected from such a limited lineup.  Very rewarding.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/91KMmQzslAL._SX425_.jpg" alt="" width="258" height="232" /></p>
<p><em><strong>Vagabond</strong> </em><strong>&#8211; Eddi Reader</strong>:  There are few singers with a more beautiful voice than Reader&#8217;s, and with John McCusker, Karen Matheson, Declan O’Rourke and Boo Hewerdine in the lineup, you know you’re in for a treat. There are no disappointments here. It is easily one of the most impressive recordings of the decade in my book.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41tPSeVCLpL._SS280.jpg" alt="" width="257" height="257" /></p>
<p><em><strong>Resolution Road</strong></em> <strong>– Easton Stagger Phillips</strong>:  This album is from a collective made up of three musicians who each have successful musical careers as individuals – Tim Easton, Leeroy Stagger, and Evan Phillips.  It is a very catchy alt country/roots rock album with hooks a plenty and incredible harmonies.  This one demands repeat playing and is thoroughly enjoyable.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/91HN6lbc1nL._SX522_.jpg" alt="" width="257" height="257" /></p>
<p><em><strong>Dharma Blues</strong></em><strong> &#8211; Peter Rowan</strong>:  This has been getting rave reviews and no wonder. Peter Rowan has been a top-notch musician since his early days under the tutelage of the father of bluegrass himself, Bill Monroe, but Rowan is so much more than a bluegrass icon.  He is constantly evolving and <em>Dharma Blues</em> is one of the best albums of his career so far. Eastern influences are all stirred up with elements of rock, folk, blues, country, gospel, and bluegrass.  This is an album that should appeal to a large audience, not just bluegrass aficionados.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/512f9%2BaV4FL._SY450_.jpg" alt="" width="257" height="257" /></p>
<p><em><strong>Lost in the Dream</strong></em> <strong>&#8211; War on Drugs</strong>: It almost seems blasphemous to put this album towards the bottom of a &#8216;best-of&#8217; list since it holds the #1 spot of almost all the &#8216;best of 2014&#8217; lists of every indie/rock/folk related website out there, but (really) this list is in no particular order. I will admit I put off listening to this one for a long time.  I don&#8217;t know &#8211; maybe it&#8217;s the band name, but it just didn&#8217;t appeal to me.  All the hoop-la finally got my curiosity up, though.  And it really <em>is</em> that good.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/519ByHWawoL._SS280.jpg" alt="" width="267" height="267" /></p>
<p><em><strong>When the Day is on the Turn</strong></em> <strong>&#8211; Dallahan</strong>:  Here we have a rollicking blast from a new band just launched a year ago.  This is Dallahan&#8217;s debut album and it features original music as well as traditional Irish tunes and songs.  The majority of the tracks are instrumentals, with vocals on five of the 12 (counting the bonus track) that range from mournful laments to toe-tapping reels.  It is easy to see why they earned an Emerging Excellence Award from Help Musicians UK and were recently nominated for Best Up and Coming Artist of the Year at the Scots Trad Music Awards 2014.</p>

<p>Psychedelic? Freak folk?  Experimental pop?  I&#8217;ve never been totally sure how to classify Panda Bear (or Animal Collective, for that matter), but whatever the term for it <em>Panda Bear Meets the Grim Reaper</em> is a definitive example.  The album is all layered vocals, synth swirls and samples, and gittery percussion.  Lead single &#8220;Mr Noah&#8221; is definitely the standout track, but the album as a whole is stronger than its predecessor <em>Tomboy</em> and almost certainly the best work from an Animal Collective member since <em>Merriweather Post Pavilion</em>.<span id="more-4815"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-january-13-2015/California-X-Nights-in-the-Dark.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4816" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-january-13-2015/California-X-Nights-in-the-Dark.jpg" alt="California X - Nights in the Dark" width="280" height="280" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-january-13-2015/California-X-Nights-in-the-Dark.jpg 280w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-january-13-2015/California-X-Nights-in-the-Dark-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 280px) 100vw, 280px" /></a><strong>California X &#8211; <em>Nights in the Dark</em></strong></p>
<p>Rock and roll is <em>not</em> dead, and California X is making sure of it.  The Amherst, Massachusetts trio is fuzzed out northeast garage rock that fits in very well with their forebears&#8217; Dinosaur Jr, Sebadoh, and Buffalo Tom.  <em>Nights in the Dark</em> is loud, heavy, and propulsive, while maintaining a melodicism that anchors the music in the pop canon.  The band doesn&#8217;t just let it rip, though.  Just as you settle into their 90&#8217;s sound, they throw you a curve ball with the acoustic &#8220;Ayla&#8217;s Song&#8221; or the piano of &#8220;Garlic Road&#8221; before returning to what they do best.</p>
<p><a href="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-january-13-2015/Dan-Mangan-Blacksmith-Club-Meds.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4817" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-january-13-2015/Dan-Mangan-Blacksmith-Club-Meds.jpg" alt="Dan Mangan + Blacksmith - Club Meds" width="280" height="280" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-january-13-2015/Dan-Mangan-Blacksmith-Club-Meds.jpg 280w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-january-13-2015/Dan-Mangan-Blacksmith-Club-Meds-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 280px) 100vw, 280px" /></a><strong>Dan Mangan + Blacksmith &#8211; <em>Club Meds</em></strong></p>
<p>Dan Mangan is a Canadian singer/songwriter of the folk rock school, and Blacksmith is the new name for what has essentially been his backing band for some time.  On <em>Club Meds</em> they make lyrics based, folk informed rock that is fully orchestrated (e.g. multiple guitars, synth washes, and occasional strings or horns over steady back beats) but still showcases Mangan&#8217;s mellow tenor vocals (Mangan sounds like a cross between Justin Vernon and Eddie Vedder).  This is an album perfect for after everyone has left the party and your left with a daunting clean up project.</p>

<p>Arca is a very of the moment producer (some of <em>Yeezus</em> and one of my favorite albums of the year FKA twigs&#8217; <em>LP1</em>), and <em>Xen</em> is very of the moment experimental electronics.  The album is hard hitting, glitchy, full of space, and in many ways harsh.  It&#8217;s also safe to say it is where a lot of experimental electronic music will be going in the next year or two.  This is an album to listen to on headphones when you don&#8217;t have anything else going on and can wallow in the oddness.<span id="more-4554"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-november-4-2014/Deerhoof-La-Isla-Bonita.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4555" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-november-4-2014/Deerhoof-La-Isla-Bonita.jpg" alt="Deerhoof - La Isla Bonita" width="280" height="280" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-november-4-2014/Deerhoof-La-Isla-Bonita.jpg 280w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-november-4-2014/Deerhoof-La-Isla-Bonita-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 280px) 100vw, 280px" /></a></p>
<p>Deerhoof &#8211; <em>La Isla Bonita</em></p>
<p>Experimental indie pop band Deerhoof has been around for 20 years and continues to explore different sonic palates.  Starting as a noise pop band before moving to quieter indie pop and exploring everything from electronics to instrument switching to Japanese vocals (primary lead singer Satomi Matsuzaki is a native of Japan), Deerhoof is one of those bands that is more influential than popular.  <em>La Isla Bonita</em> is an excellent distillation of their sound while appearing more on the less experimental end of the spectrum.  It&#8217;s also just a really fun listen.</p>
<p><a href="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-november-4-2014/We-Are-the-Willows-Picture-Portrait.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4557" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-november-4-2014/We-Are-the-Willows-Picture-Portrait.jpg" alt="We Are the Willows - Picture (Portrait)" width="280" height="280" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-november-4-2014/We-Are-the-Willows-Picture-Portrait.jpg 280w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-november-4-2014/We-Are-the-Willows-Picture-Portrait-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 280px) 100vw, 280px" /></a>We Are the Willows &#8211; <em>Picture (Portrait)</em></p>
<p>As We Are the Willows, Peter Miller makes lovely singer/songwriter style folk.  For this album he drew lyrical inspiration from a few hundred letters written by his grandfather to his grandmother during World War II.  Backed by an excellent band, including a string section, the songs on <em>Picture (Portrait)</em> are written in the first person.  This decision brings an immediacy to what could otherwise be an overly syrupy conceit.  (It also makes Miller his own grandpa&#8230;yes that&#8217;s a terrible joke about a really sweet idea/album.)  Listening to Miller, as his grandfather, ask his beloved not to worry about him because he&#8217;s &#8220;got God and coffee grounds&#8221; and assuring her he intends to marry her is truly a special experience.  It brings a good deal of happiness, because we know he was successful, but there is also an undercurrent of sadness for all the soldiers who wrote similar words but were unable to follow through with them.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;"><em>It might shock you to learn that the authors at Music is Good love music and listen to a lot of it, and we&#8217;re guessing you do too.  One of the great things about music, are those occasions when we are struck by a particular song that resonates with us in a special way.  Maybe a catchy beat simply caught our ear.  Maybe it&#8217;s a particularly beautiful voice.  Maybe it was a particular way the lyrics blended with the melody and the musical accompaniment, or perhaps the lyrics were especially apropos to a current experience or feeling we had at the time.  Whatever the reason, that particular song had us hitting the ‘replay’ button over and over.  This series spotlights some of the songs that did it for us. They will vary in genre but all will have one thing in common </em><em>– that special ‘something.’</em></p>
<p> My Song of the Week is &#8220;Psalm of Life&#8221;.  It is on the album <em>Gift</em>, the first collaborative recording by the mother-and-daughter team, Eliza Carthy and Norma Waterson, who make up part of British folk’s great dynasty.</p>
<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/NfT2kRk6KEw" height="315" width="420" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p><span id="more-4059"></span>The song puts to music the classic poem of the same name by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow.  It is one of my favorite poems.  Longfellow said of it, ‘I kept it some time in manuscript, unwilling to show it to any one, it being a voice from my inmost heart, at a time when I was rallying from depression.’  (Longfellow’s young wife was burned to death in an accident while lighting a candle.  The flames caught her skirts on fire and completely engulfed her.)</p>
<p>When I discovered that Carthy &amp; Waterson had set this poem to music, I was anxious to hear what these two brilliant artists would do with it, but my eagerness was also tempered with some trepidation.  Such a powerful poem could be trivialized and ruined so easily with the wrong interpretation.  I needn’t have worried.  Carthy &amp; Waterson nail it.  The melody they have chosen is perfectly suited to the spirit of the poem, as are the vocals and accompanying instruments.  Graceful piano notes contrast with earthy, almost clumsy-sounding trombone notes. The same contrast is echoed in the vocals, where Carthy’s beautifully smooth voice is heard alongside Waterson’s more rough, edgy one.  This smooth/rough, graceful/awkward, heavenly/earthy combination of sounds paints a very effective sonic picture of the literary message of Longfellow’s poem &#8211; a broken, depressed soul’s fumbling journey to reach an endpoint of comfort and contentment.  There is a beautiful, somewhat melancholy instrumental break featuring a violin that is also in perfect keeping with the spirit of the poem.  The song’s chorus, repeated throughout the song as one would expect,  repeats the poem’s last stanza (“let us, then, be up and doing/with a heart for any fate/still achieving, still pursuing/learn to  labor and to wait”), and is particularly fitting since it conveys the main point Longfellow wished to make.   I cannot think of a better way to express the poem musically than what Carthy and Waterson have accomplished.</p>
<p>Here are the lyrics, followed by the story behind the poem:</p>
<p>A PSALM OF LIFE</p>
<p>TELL me not, in mournful numbers,</p>
<p>Life is but an empty dream ! —</p>
<p>For the soul is dead that slumbers,</p>
<p>And things are not what they seem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Life is real ! Life is earnest!</p>
<p>And the grave is not its goal ;</p>
<p>Dust thou art, to dust returnest,</p>
<p>Was not spoken of the soul.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not enjoyment, and not sorrow,</p>
<p>Is our destined end or way ;</p>
<p>But to act, that each to-morrow</p>
<p>Find us farther than to-day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Art is long, and Time is fleeting,</p>
<p>And our hearts, though stout and brave,</p>
<p>Still, like muffled drums, are beating</p>
<p>Funeral marches to the grave.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the world&#8217;s broad field of battle,</p>
<p>In the bivouac of Life,</p>
<p>Be not like dumb, driven cattle !</p>
<p>Be a hero in the strife !</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Trust no Future, howe&#8217;er pleasant !</p>
<p>Let the dead Past bury its dead !</p>
<p>Act,— act in the living Present !</p>
<p>Heart within, and God o&#8217;erhead !</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lives of great men all remind us</p>
<p>We can make our lives sublime,</p>
<p>And, departing, leave behind us</p>
<p>Footprints on the sands of time ;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Footprints, that perhaps another,</p>
<p>Sailing o&#8217;er life&#8217;s solemn main,</p>
<p>A forlorn and shipwrecked brother,</p>
<p>Seeing, shall take heart again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us, then, be up and doing,</p>
<p>With a heart for any fate ;</p>
<p>Still achieving, still pursuing,</p>
<p>Learn to labor and to wait.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>THE STORY BEHIND THE PSALM (from <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1270698.Light_From_Many_Lamps?auto_login_attempted=true">&#8220;Light from Many Lamps&#8221;</a> 124-126 (Lillian Watson, ed., Touchstone 1988):</p>
<p>“It was early morning. The bright sun streamed through the windows of the Craigie house in Cambridge where George Washington had once had his headquarters, and where a young Harvard professor now lived. He lived, in fact, in the very room that Washington had occupied. And as he stood gazing out of the window at the sloping lawn and the elms, he wondered if Washington might not have stood here once feeling perhaps as he did&#8211;unutterably lonely and dejected. The young man&#8217;s wife had died three years ago, but he longed for her still. Time had not softened his grief nor eased the torment of his memories. He turned restlessly from the window and wondered how to spend the time before breakfast.</p>
<p>He was a poet too, this young professor; but he had no heart for poetry these days. He had no heart for anything, it seemed. Life had become an empty dream. But this could not go on, he told himself! He was letting the days slip by, nursing his despondency. Life was not an empty dream! He must be up and doing. Let the dead past bury its dead. . . . Suddenly Henry Wadsworth Longfellow was writing in a surge of inspiration, the lines coming almost too quickly for his racing pen. Longfellow called his poem &#8220;A Psalm of Life.&#8221; He put it aside at first, unwilling to show it to anyone; for as he later explained, &#8220;it was a voice from my inmost heart, at a time when I was rallying from depression.&#8221;</p>
<p>But later he allowed it to be published . . .and it went straight to the hearts of millions of people. No poem ever written became so well known so fast. It was taught in schools, recited on the stage, discussed from pulpit and lecture platform. It crossed the ocean, and spread like wildfire through England. It was translated into French, German, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Dutch, Swedish, Danish&#8211;even Sanskrit! In China it was printed on a fan and became immensely popular. A whole generation of school children grew up under the influence of Longfellow&#8217;s &#8220;Psalm.&#8221; Many prominent men later acknowledged that influence with gratitude. Henry Ford, for example, memorized it as a lad, and in later years often said that the sixth and ninth stanzas came back to him all his life, inspiring him to effort and achievement. Firestone also freely acknowledged his indebtedness to the poem, as did many other famous men. Edward Bok made a special visit to Longfellow to tell him how much the last four lines meant to him. Even Gandhi, on the other side of the world, quoted a favorite line from it just a few days before his death (&#8220;&#8230;.things are not what they seem&#8221;). The call to courage and action of a man emerging from a great sorrow, &#8220;A Psalm of Life&#8221; is one of the best-loved and most widely read poems in the world. Its lines are full of hope, its message clear and unmistakable. Its appeal is as vital and timely now as it ever was; in a recent poll to determine the nation&#8217;s favorite poem, it easily won first place.</p>
<p>For over a hundred years &#8220;A Psalm of Life&#8221; has helped the weary, unhappy, and discouraged to be &#8220;up and doing, with a heart for any fate.&#8221; No poem more richly deserves its place among the inspirational classics of mankind.”</p>

<p><em>I reviewed <a title="Review: Valta by Alamaailman Vasarat" href="http://musicisgood.org/2012/07/review-valta-by-alamaailman-vasarat/" target="_blank">here</a> the most recent album by Finnish band <a title="Alamaailman Vasarat homepage" href="http://vasarat.com/" target="_blank">Alamaailman Vasarat</a>. Following that review, Stakula, the band&#8217;s leader, kindly agreed to an interview, offering some insights into the processes behind the music.<br />
</em><br />
<strong><em>Valta</em> is an addition to what by now is a substantial body of work, and Alamaailman Vasarat has established a distinctive sound. Has anything changed on this album compared to previous releases?</strong></p>
<p>The most obvious changes were in the lineup. Before the <em>Valta</em> sessions, our new drummer Santeri Saksala had already performed with the band for a year, much to our enjoyment. The live performances really tightened up and had a whole new level of energy. In the <em>Valta</em> sessions, his knowledge and passion for the drums as instruments made a huge difference to album sound, not forgetting some of the most memorable improvised moments, like in the opening track &#8220;Riistomaasiirtäjä&#8221;. His contribution has made a huge impact in the overall sound of the band and we&#8217;re very happy to have him on board.<span id="more-3572"></span></p>
<p>The most difficult move was the second lead change from trombone to trumpet/alto horn in the middle of the <em>Valta</em> sessions, sometime during March 2012. Jarkko Niemelä joined the band with background in classical, jazz and Balkan music &#8211; just a perfect combination of skills for the band. He learned and recorded all the new songs unbelievably quickly and we were able to keep the original release timetable. Now, after performing with Jarkko at several gigs all around, also the older songs have a new life with sparkling trumpet leads. This is certainly a Vasarat version II, so much has changed for the better in a very short time.</p>
<p>To understand <em>Valta</em> better, I need to go back a little bit: <em>Huuro Kolkko</em>, the album before <em>Valta</em>, released in 2009, was a concept piece with a complex storyline going through the whole thing. While interesting way to do music and we&#8217;re most happy with the end result, we didn&#8217;t want to repeat that all over again. But we didn&#8217;t just want to make a random collection of songs either.</p>
<p>So, <em>Valta</em> does have a concept, but it&#8217;s more ideological and less linear. <em>Valta</em> is a musical study about valta (a Finnish word for &#8220;power&#8221;) from several angles. Tyranny is one aspect of it and heavily present in the songs like &#8220;Riistomaasiirtäjä&#8221; and &#8220;Hirmuhallinto&#8221;. More subtle, but ancient power is found in dreams, legends and stories like Henkipatto and Hajakas. There&#8217;s also a lot of emotional power in everyday life of the ordinary people. Their joys and griefs are highlighted in songs like &#8220;Haudankantaja&#8221; and &#8220;Uurnilla&#8221;. But like most Alamaailman Vasarat albums, <em>Valta</em> gives the listener a lot of room to interpret the songs freely, maybe totally differently than what we originally thought. And that is the power of instrumental music.</p>
<p>In our thoughts, we always return to our imaginary country Vasaraasia, (name of our debut album from 2000), and in some way <em>Valta</em> is also the partial history of that place, a combination of short stories about how power has affected Vasaraasian people in the past and today. <em>Valta</em> may also be a prelude to fundamental change in Vasaraasia, maybe a prelude to the next album, we&#8217;ll see!</p>
<p><strong>That combination of having something to say but also leaving listeners to weave their own stories from the music itself is interesting. I get the sense from all of your work to date that on the one hand you like to build ideas around your music, to create stories and conceits that frame the albums, yet on the other hand you sound as if you just take sheer delight in a great tune for its own sake. How does that balance out when you are composing? Do the ideas come before, after, or with the music?</strong></p>
<p>As a long-time fan of movies, sci-fi and fantasy literature, etc. I&#8217;m always thinking about some sort of setting right from the start. It&#8217;s a natural way of composing for me and I suppose other band members may have picked up that technique along the way too, during these past 16 years. When I&#8217;m humming a melody in my head, I picture myself in an imaginary movie, sometimes as the main character, sometimes just an observer. Melody itself may lead to many changes in this imaginary settings and new ideas when it comes to arranging.</p>
<p>Orchestration and arranging are in many ways the most important things in Alamaailman Vasarat music production. All the instruments we have at our disposal are very flexible and we like to experiment with different music styles all the time, often combining them even in the same song. Also, because the music we do is instrumental, we don&#8217;t have to follow that many rules when it comes to song structures. Imaginary settings also free us to think outside the box and let the vision flow. All you need is a strong composition, everything else is open for discussion!</p>
<p><strong>Given what you have said about how you compose, it seems as if video would be a natural medium for you, and there was some video work accompanying some of your earlier pieces. Is that something you plan to explore more in the future?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, we&#8217;ve done some music videos in the past, starting with &#8220;Kebab tai henki!&#8221; which was shot in B&amp;W 8mm in Helsinki and also &#8220;Violence trilogy&#8221;, featuring three music videos shot in B&amp;W 16mm in Prague. All of those were sort of like silent short movies, scored by Alamaailman Vasarat. We even approached the whole projects like movies, starting with a proper script and all.</p>
<p>The funniest thing was when we were making &#8220;Kebab tai henki!&#8221;. The director called me and said that they had some good footage left but the song was too short to fit the footage in. I called Marko, our cellist, and we went to the rehearsal room to compose an additional part for the song. The director was kind of surprised but very pleased! The video got much better and the extra part is now permanently part of the song.</p>
<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/nRr230J4mH8?rel=0" height="315" width="420" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>We&#8217;ve been thinking about doing videos like these more in the future, but it&#8217;s a question of funding and time. We&#8217;re big fans of grainy film which makes these productions much more expensive compared to shooting digital. But we&#8217;ll see, maybe it happens in the future!</p>
<p><strong>Does the emphasis on setting extend to the physical setting in which the music is made? I gather there&#8217;s a story connected with the recent album involving a tower and some wine&#8230;</strong></p>
<p>Yes, recently we&#8217;ve been experimenting with some unusual sound techniques. For the outro of &#8220;Hirmuhallinto&#8221;, the last track of the latest album <em>Valta</em>, I envisioned a water dropper which could act as a rhythmic background for the other instruments. It turned out even better when the band guys built it &#8211; we got a good sound out of a special metallic box which was hit by liquid drops from some four meters up, gradually slowing down as the liquid ran out in a very natural way. After testing, we found out that only using red wine as the liquid gave the right kind of sound. It also really opened up the wine!</p>
<p>Natural, slightly random elements during the recording process may give the music some unexpected and fresh feeling. They will also create great memories and make the sessions more special. I&#8217;m sure we will try these weird techniques out more in the future!</p>
<p><strong>I sense in your compositions and in your comments both a joy in music and a seriousness about music. What would you say music is for? Why is it so important?</strong></p>
<p>Hard question! Well, I don&#8217;t really know if anything is really &#8220;for&#8221; anything, but certainly music has an important role in defining human emotion in an abstract and untouchable way. Yes, it is based on movement of air, but still music triggers something in our minds which is way deeper than just physics or mere numbers. I believe as long as there are random elements in music and the path from a vague musical idea to listener&#8217;s ear is a surprising journey, music will stay important!</p>
