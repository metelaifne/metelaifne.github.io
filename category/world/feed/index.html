				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Can it be a year since the last list? Here goes with my favorite 20 releases of 2017. Your tastes are not mine, you will disagree, but maybe there is something here that you might not have discovered, something of beauty that might bring you joy. At one point I thought this might be a thin year; when I got down to making the list I realized there was no filler at the bottom. Exact placement is fuzzy – there are lots of apples and oranges being compared here. Feel free to move any of these up or down a few places in your head.</p>
<p><a href="https://12kmusic.bandcamp.com/album/somi"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5412" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/top-20-of-2017-david-smith/Somi-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="200" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/top-20-of-2017-david-smith/Somi-300x300.jpg 300w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/top-20-of-2017-david-smith/Somi-150x150.jpg 150w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/top-20-of-2017-david-smith/Somi.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" /></a><strong>#1. Taylor Deupree – Somi</strong></p>
<p>Deupree’s <em>Faint</em> from a few years ago is still one of my regular listens and pleasures, and I wonder with hindsight if I should have placed it at number one that year. He gave me another chance with the magnificent, meditative <em>Somi</em>. Loops of single notes from acoustic instruments played at varying intervals are layered and treated to create a fascinating slow dance of beauty and rest. And the deluxe edition packaging was as gorgeous as the music. (<a href="https://12kmusic.bandcamp.com/album/somi">Listen</a>)</p>

<p><strong>#2. Daniel Herskedal – The Roc</strong></p>
<p>Norwegian tubaist Herskedal’s new album adds an Arabic influence to his tuba-based jazz-folk explorations. The result is a unique, at times magical set of tunes high in atmosphere and richly colored. Several parts of this album stayed in my head all year. (<a href="https://danielherskedal.bandcamp.com/album/the-roc">Listen</a>)</p>

<p><a href="https://dronarivm.bandcamp.com/album/avifaunal"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5429" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/top-20-of-2017-david-smith/Pausal-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/top-20-of-2017-david-smith/Pausal-150x150.jpg 150w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/top-20-of-2017-david-smith/Pausal-300x300.jpg 300w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/top-20-of-2017-david-smith/Pausal-768x768.jpg 768w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/top-20-of-2017-david-smith/Pausal-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/top-20-of-2017-david-smith/Pausal.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>#3. Pausal – Avifaunal</strong></p>
<p>Pausal’s warm and finely textured drones have been growing on me the last few years. This year’s release took things up a notch, with a sweeping grandeur and narrative flow that make each minute count. An album to get lost in. (<a href="https://dronarivm.bandcamp.com/album/avifaunal">Listen</a>)</p>

<p><strong>#4. Anat Cohen Tentet – Happy Song</strong></p>
<p>The title and bright yellow cover are apt. New York-based Israeli clarinetist Cohen and her ensemble deliver a vibrantly grooving set of jazz romps that shift in character as the album progresses while maintaining an infectious sense of joy. (<a href="http://anzicstore.com/album/happy-song">Listen</a>)</p>

<p><strong>#5. Tinariwen – Elwan</strong></p>
<p>The Saharan blues return with the latest from the great Tuareg band, and it’s one of their finest. The sinuous, swaying rhythms undergird starkly poetic laments at the loss of social and environmental fabric.

<p><strong>#6. Seldom Sene Recorder Consort – Goldberg Variations</strong></p>
<p>As the title gives away, this is the Goldberg Variations played on recorders by a Dutch recorder consort. In addition to the virtuoso playing, the different sonorities of the wind instruments made the Goldbergs sparkle for me in a gentle and delightful new way.

<p><strong>#7. Otto A. Totland – The Lost</strong></p>
<p>Very similar in spirit to its predecessor, <em>Pinô</em>, this second album of piano solos again showcases Norwegian pianist Otto Totland’s ability to conjure a gentle, plaintive warmth through small melodies and soft sounds. (<a href="https://ottoatotland.bandcamp.com/">Listen</a>)</p>

<p><a href="https://chiheihatakeyama.bandcamp.com/album/sora"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5413" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/top-20-of-2017-david-smith/Sora-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/top-20-of-2017-david-smith/Sora-150x150.jpg 150w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/top-20-of-2017-david-smith/Sora-300x300.jpg 300w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/top-20-of-2017-david-smith/Sora-768x768.jpg 768w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/top-20-of-2017-david-smith/Sora-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/top-20-of-2017-david-smith/Sora.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>#8. Chihei Hatakeyama &amp; Federico Durand – Sora</strong></p>
<p>Combining Hatakeyama’s characteristic gossamer tonal washes and Durand’s delightfully pattering small sounds is a recipe for enormous prettiness, and that is just what we get on this deeply calming album. (<a href="https://chiheihatakeyama.bandcamp.com/album/sora">Listen</a>)</p>

<p><strong>#9. The Green Kingdom – The North Wind and the Sun</strong></p>
<p>The Green Kingdom has issued a long series of recordings offering an attractive world of delicate small sounds and textures. This release feels like something fresh as it bursts forth into uplifting melody thanks to the foregrounded guitar work.

<p><strong>#10. Emile Parisien, Vincent Peirani, Andreas Schaerer &amp; Michael Wollny – Out of Land</strong></p>
<p>An unusual but top-notch European jazz combo consisting of sax, accordion, piano, and vocalizations/beatboxing. The live recordings prickle with energy and abound in creativity, making for an exciting listen. (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAKio4qfeqM">Watch</a>)</p>

<p><strong>#11. Fieldhead – We’ve All Been Swimming</strong></p>
<p>Fieldhead’s latest is by far my favorite by the artist so far. It plays with odd rhythmic combinations, layering looping synth melodies over divergent rhythms. The result is a kind of mellow fascination, and great fun. (<a href="https://homeassemblymusic.bandcamp.com/album/weve-all-been-swimming">Listen</a>)</p>

<p><strong>#12. Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark – The Punishment of Luxury</strong></p>
<p>Not much pop makes my lists, but I loved OMD as a teen, and this new release sounds as if it could have been the immediate follow up to 1983’s <em>Dazzle Ships</em>. It nails what made their original Kraftwerk-with-soul sound special, and that made me grin. (<a href="https://officialomd.bandcamp.com/releases">Listen</a>)</p>

<p><strong>#13. Rudresh Mahanthappa/Indo-Pak Coalition – Agrima </strong></p>

<p><strong>#14. Helge Lien Trio – Guzuguzu</strong></p>
<p>With track titles drawn from Japanese onomatopoeia, Helge Lien’s latest piano trio album is made up of moody evocations of atmosphere and movement, often skirting around song structures. Sparkling piano breaks through like rays of sunlight. (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u8uNWIroJQ">Watch</a>)</p>

<p><strong>#15. Porya Hatami – Monads</strong></p>
<p>When I posted my review of this to Facebook none of my friends hit “like,” and it is admittedly a pretty abstract set of experiments with sound rather than a collection of tunes. But they are fascinating experiments, glimpses into the push-and-pull of forces that make the world a place with sound.

<p><strong>#16. Yazz Ahmed – La Saboteuse</strong></p>
<p>Ahmed is a British-Bahraini trumpeter who here successfully melds Arabic motifs, electronic treatments, and jazz trumpet in a set of beguiling tunes. (<a href="https://yazzahmed.bandcamp.com/album/la-saboteuse-2">Listen</a>)</p>

<p><strong>#17. Alea Saxophone Quartet – Arvo Pärt: Anima</strong></p>
<p>If the idea of Pärt played on saxophones conjures up a mental collision of ethereal voices and ill-chosen skronking, think again. The pure tones and harmonies of the sax quartet evocatively capture the spirit of Pärt’s austere choral pieces. (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjbB3NPiL1QTbsipfDysz0M1KRCfMzeLD">Listen</a>)</p>

<p><strong>#18. Taylor Deupree &amp; Marcus Fischer – Lowlands</strong></p>
<p>Building on previous outings as a duo, Deupree and Fischer again show a mastery of the microscopic world of small resonances, adding another delightful release to their growing oeuvre. (<a href="https://12kmusic.bandcamp.com/album/lowlands">Listen</a>)</p>

<p><strong>#19. Brot &amp; Sterne – Tales of Herbst</strong></p>
<p>This was not quite like anything else I listened to, which is perhaps not surprising in the case of a hurdy-gurdy/hang drum/trumpet jazz trio. The improvised instrumentals set warmly tuneful passages amid unique and atmospheric textures. (<a href="https://brotundsterne.bandcamp.com/releases">Listen</a>)</p>

<p><strong>#20. Billow Observatory – II: Plains/Patterns </strong></p>
<p>More active than their debut release, this collection of ambient pieces pulses and shimmers airily. Enjoyable throughout. (<a href="https://billowobservatory.bandcamp.com/album/ii-plains-patterns">Listen</a>)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The next 10&#8230;</strong></p>
<p>And here are ten more that I had a really hard time cutting to get the list down to 20. Some of these jumped in and out of my list several times, and might have made it if I had finalized the list tomorrow. Alphabetically:</p>
<p>Wil Bolton – Night Paths (Ambient)</p>
<p>Bruce Cockburn – Bone on Bone (Folk)</p>
<p>Marcus Fischer – Loss (Ambient)</p>
<p>From the Mouth of the Sun – Hymn Binding (Modern Classical)</p>
<p>Ian Hawgood &amp; Wil Bolton – Transparencies (Ambient)</p>
<p>Hudson – Hudson (Jazz)</p>
<p>Rafael Anton Irisarri – The Shameless Years (Ambient)</p>
<p>Benedikt Jahnel Trio – The Invariant (Piano jazz)</p>
<p>Darren McClure – Nature Mirror (Ambient)</p>
<p>Phronesis, Julian Argüelles, &amp; Frankfurt Radio Big Band – The Behemoth (Jazz)</p>
<p>As ever, if any of the artists happen by, thank you for another year of inspiring music.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s been a quiet 2016 at <em>Music is Good</em>. Professional commitments have left some regulars with less time for blogging. But we&#8217;re still listening. Here are my top 20 albums for 2016. I excluded compilations (though <a href="http://shop.serein.co.uk/album/orbital-planes-passenger-trains-vol-1"><em>Orbital Planes &amp; Passenger Trains, Vol. 1</em></a> from Serein, <a href="https://dronarivm.bandcamp.com/album/into-the-white-new-years-2016-free-compilation"><em>Into the White</em></a> from Dronarivm, and <a href="https://www.fat-cat.co.uk/release/eleven-into-fifteen-a-130701-compilation"><em>Eleven into Fifteen</em></a> from 130701 all delighted me). As ever, this is the best in my subjective judgment of what I heard and liked, no more, and the numbering is less important than the chance of helping someone find something good that they missed. This year I am treating EPs separately, <a href="http://musicisgood.org/?p=5331&#038;preview=true">in a second post</a>.<span id="more-5329"></span></p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5357" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/top-20-of-2016-david-smith/durand-traves-150x150.jpg" alt="durand-traves" width="200" height="200" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/top-20-of-2016-david-smith/durand-traves-150x150.jpg 150w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/top-20-of-2016-david-smith/durand-traves-300x300.jpg 300w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/top-20-of-2016-david-smith/durand-traves.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" /></p>
<p><strong>#1.</strong> <a href="https://federicodurand.bandcamp.com/album/a-trav-s-del-espejo"><strong>Federico Durand – A Través Del Espejo</strong></a><br />
This delightful album was released on 12k early in the year, and I kept listening to it all year. (My wife liked it too, which is far from guaranteed with the more experimental fringes of my listening.) A childlike celebration of tiny, fragile sounds, and a reminder of what can be destroyed by noise and bombast, this album offers a series of delicate meditations on the vulnerable beauty of sound. Durand&#8217;s <a href="https://federicodurand.bandcamp.com/"><em>Jardín de invierno</em></a> (on Spekk) deserves honorable mention in the same vein, but it was this earlier release that captivated my ears the most this year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>#2. <a href="https://play.spotify.com/album/2EvZiOMBlC9b5hbjbZCjZv?play=true&#038;utm_source=open.spotify.com&#038;utm_medium=open">Nicolas Jaar &#8211; Sirens</a></strong><br />
The haunting first track displays magnificently Jaar&#8217;s precise mastery of his palette of sounds. The album continues with a compelling sideways take on a variety of song forms, with the thematic focus on a culture of political violence providing a dark textual undercurrent. A remarkable piece of work, whether one focuses on the catchy songs, on the textual warnings, or on the meticulously shaped sonic shifts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5351" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/top-20-of-2016-david-smith/Sunergy-Smith-150x150.jpg" alt="sunergy-smith" width="150" height="150" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/top-20-of-2016-david-smith/Sunergy-Smith-150x150.jpg 150w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/top-20-of-2016-david-smith/Sunergy-Smith-300x300.jpg 300w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/top-20-of-2016-david-smith/Sunergy-Smith.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></p>
<p>#<strong>3. <a href="https://kaitlynaureliasmith.bandcamp.com/album/frkwys-vol-13-sunergy">Kaitlyn Aurelia Smith &amp; Suzanne Ciani &#8211; Sunergy</a></strong><br />
An inspired set of Buchla synthesizer improvisations from a senior master of the art and a new rising star (Smith&#8217;s solo album <a href="https://kaitlynaureliasmith.bandcamp.com/album/ears"><em>Ears</em></a> this year was also excellent). Sequences burble and sparkle over shifting hums and currents, providing a compelling update to the long-form analog synthesizer genre.</p>

What if Brian Eno&#8217;s classic ambient work, <em>Music for Airports,</em> were recorded as a jazz album? Chris Schlarb showed us this year that the results could be very enjoyable indeed. We also get a new, complementary piece, the &#8220;working man&#8217;s counterpart&#8221; to music for airports titled &#8220;Music for Bus Stops.&#8221; Both pieces charmed me.</p>

An acoustic guitar meanders gently and peacefully as an unsettled bed of chirping, buzzing, warbling, squeaking electronics chatters tensely alongside, setting up a fascinating conversation that sometimes produces tension, sometimes converges.</p>

Ostermeier &#8211; Tiny Birds</a></strong><br />
Building on last year&#8217;s <em>Still</em>, M. Ostermeier returned with an aptly titled collection of short, plaintive piano pieces. Accompanied by background rustles and rattles, the tracks are sparse, stark, melancholy, almost hesitant in their deliberation. The sound is intimate, inviting us to slow down and attend rather than carrying us along.</p>

David Newman&#8217;s recent releases have struck an absorbing balance between experimental exploration of the properties of sound and a melodic presence, and this collaboration with Justin Varis continues in the same rich vein. Remixes by various luminaries of the genre add a further dimension to this charming collection of off-kilter pieces.</p>

Korwar takes field recordings of folk music from Indian villages and marries them with jazz and electronics so skilfully that it is hard to see the joins. Raw recordings of chant and percussion from India provide the substrate that morphs into engaging jazz sequences that extend the sources without leaving them behind. A striking, unusual release.</p>

Loscil continues to find new angles on his distinctive sound, and his latest contains some of his most aggressive rhythms to date. It also serves up a fresh helping of his signature hypnotically shimmering pulses. I have never met a Loscil album I didn&#8217;t like, and this latest release more than kept the streak going.</p>

Resonant guitar notes follow one another at a gentle, leisurely pace. An ethereal atmosphere builds amid their resonance. Chiming rhythms eventually arrive, but only accentuate the calm. The album drifts by lazily, a slow caress.</p>

An evocative follow-up to Tiento de las Nieves, Tiento de la Luz offers a glacially paced interaction of piano, viola da gamba, and electronics. As usual with Köner, deep frequencies and extended textures play an important role, with the decay of each note held before us for contemplation. Mesmerizing listening.</p>

<p><strong>#12. <a href="https://slaapwel.bandcamp.com/album/filament">Gareth Davis &#8211; Filament</a></strong><br />
A rich, undulating, 35-minute drone, embedded in field recordings of the ocean, gains texture from the use of bass and contrabass clarinet along with electronics. Deep rumbles and whale-song-like squeaks ebb, and flow, and sway to deeply atmospheric effect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Native American sonic references may be a little hokey here and there, but the more I listened to this release from French jazz bass veteran Henri Texier the more the tunes sank their hooks into me. The live reprise released later in the year, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dakota-Mab-Live-Theater-G-tersloh/dp/B01CORX2WE/ref=tmm_msc_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&#038;qid=&#038;sr=" class="broken_link"><em>Dakota Mab</em></a>, is worth a listen too.</p>

<p><strong>#14 <a href="https://timereleasedsound.bandcamp.com/album/kaziwa">Porya Hatami and Arovane &#8211; Kaziwa</a></strong></p>
<p>Piano again, now heard through a rich haze of sonic manipulation, tinkling amid a crackle and rush of air, emerging from a busy hum, chiming like bells, meandering sadly, punctuating an ominous buzz. Porya Hatami and Uwe Zahn keep shifting the sonic palette a little, crowding the electronic atmosphere with portent as the piano soldiers bravely on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

#15. <a href="https://machinefabriek.bandcamp.com/album/crumble">Machinefabriek &#8211; Crumble</a></strong><br />
This is not background music. It seems at any given moment as if little is happening, yet the whole unfolds in a way that feels tautly dramatic, like a small movie made of slight violin scrapes, hisses, metallic reverberations, wordless vocalizations, the sounds of something important happening, just over the horizon and almost out of earshot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5347" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/top-20-of-2016-david-smith/Nonkeen-gamble-150x150.jpg" alt="nonkeen-gamble" width="150" height="150" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/top-20-of-2016-david-smith/Nonkeen-gamble-150x150.jpg 150w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/top-20-of-2016-david-smith/Nonkeen-gamble-300x300.jpg 300w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/top-20-of-2016-david-smith/Nonkeen-gamble.jpg 319w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" />#16. <a href="https://nonkeen.bandcamp.com/album/the-gamble">Nonkeen &#8211; The Gamble</a></strong><br />
Nils Frahm got together with some childhood friends to revisit and remix some tapes they had made decades ago. The result is a collection of atmospheric lo-fi instrumentals that somehow manage to sound reminiscent of Frahm&#8217;s solo work while being little like his previous material in form.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

McClure trades more in precise measures of sound than in tunes. Each track on this immersive, painstakingly crafted album invites the listener to meditate on a specific quality of carefully constructed sound, ranging from the nature-tinged water-and-hum of the opening track to almost-not-there gossamer drones and unexpected pulses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

There are stretches in which this album sounds like a gaggle of synthesizers improvising by themselves, without human intervention. Bright, chiming sounds ripple and cascade merrily. Stick around, though, and the two long pieces begin to develop and morph, building into rich swathes of sound.</p>

Drone and noise, crackle and hum, chaotic dissolution of sound and a massive sense of grandeur &#8211; these are the basic building blocks of <em>Continuum</em>. Jebanasam sets out to capture &#8220;the spectrum of life, power and energy present in the universe&#8221; and emerges with a dramatic set of drone compositions.</p>

The practically ungooglable title gave me some trouble tracking down this unusual release. It began from recordings of the sounds of bees in their hives and built instrumental compositions around the bee drones and buzzes. The music is pastoral, and the interweaving of natural and instrumental sounds is quite sensitively done.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here is my top 20 music releases for 2015, with no claim that they are somehow objectively the best or that I listened to everything anyone else did. I have found things that delighted me on other people’s lists, and the point of the exercise is not to replicate or compete with those lists but to highlight some things you may not have found, things that might delight you. The sequence changed every time I made a shortlist, so take the numbers with a pinch of salt – all of them could be at least plus or minus 5 on a given day.<span id="more-5218"></span></p>
<p><img class="alignleft wp-image-5195" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/review-inscriptions-by-wil-bolton/Inscriptions-150x150.jpg" alt="Inscriptions" width="200" height="200" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/review-inscriptions-by-wil-bolton/Inscriptions-150x150.jpg 150w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/review-inscriptions-by-wil-bolton/Inscriptions.jpg 280w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>#1.</strong> <strong>Wil Bolton – Inscriptions</strong><br />
I have loved many of Wil Bolton’s releases, and this one was especially captivating, a cohesive suite of carefully textured ambient soundscapes of great warmth and delicacy. A delight for the ears from start to finish. Full review <a href="http://musicisgood.org/2015/12/review-inscriptions-by-wil-bolton/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>#2. Nils Frahm – Solo</strong><br />
Nils Frahm has had a prolific year, including a film score and electronic duets with Ólafur Arnalds, but where he remains unrivaled is as a painter of fragile intimacy on the piano. This collection of solo piano pieces did not disappoint, offering both slow affection and rhythmic drive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5233" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Kari-Ikonen-150x150.jpg" alt="Kari Ikonen" width="150" height="150" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Kari-Ikonen-150x150.jpg 150w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Kari-Ikonen.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>#<strong>3. Kari Ikonen Trio &#8211; Beauteous Tales and Offbeat Stories</strong><br />
From scampering piano romps to meditative arco bass passages, from stately melodies to discordant experimental interludes, this album charms with its variety and adds another thread to my fondness for Scandinavian piano jazz.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5229" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Hatami-mcclure-150x150.jpg" alt="Hatami mcclure" width="150" height="150" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Hatami-mcclure-150x150.jpg 150w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Hatami-mcclure.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" />#4. Porya Hatami and Darren Mcclure – In-Between Spaces</strong><br />
A delicious marriage of McClure’s abstract tones and Hatami’s gently burbling textures, this joint essay in textured ambiance is gently reflective in mood, a continual, fragile, questing movement within a basic rest. Another excellent release for Hatami, and a fine companion to McClure’s excellent Primary Locations from earlier in the year.</p>

Den Sorte Skole – Indians and Cowboys</strong><br />
Den Sorte Skole take thousands of small samples from old vinyl records and weave them into eclectic tapestries in which they become a cohesive, dappled, new whole. An unerring sense of groove is married to sounds and voices from the past and around the world. Get it for free at the artists’ site <a href="http://densorteskole.net/">here</a>.</p>

Esmerine &#8211; Lost Voices</strong><br />
Marimba, percussion and strings are the backbone of Esmerine’s moody miniatures. The music sometimes shares the ponderous majesty of related bands godspeed you! black emperor and Thee Silver Mt. Zion, but its idiom is more acoustic, rooted in marimba, strings and drums. Lost Voices builds gentle rhythms, passages of lyrical beauty, and outbreaks of restrained melodic intensity into a wistful and dramatic whole, arguably their best yet.</p>

Emily Hall – Folie à Deux</strong><br />
Ostensibly an opera about shared delusion and receiving cosmic messages from an electricity pylon, this charming release sounds more like ambient than opera. Pure, melodic voices meditate dreamily on madness and our relationship to each other and the world that speaks through our electric technologies to the accompaniment of electronic textures, creating a mesmerizing and delightful sound.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Kangding Ray – Cory Arcane</strong><br />
I expected this year’s blockbuster from the raster-noton label to be Alva Noto’s Xerrox 3 (which I liked, but am still growing to love), but in the short term at least was more impacted by Kangding Ray’s uneasily skittering techno. Intricate rhythms shift and collide, accompanied by a narrative about the decay of consumerist technological society yet carrying a visceral appeal as pure sound.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5222" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Autistici-150x150.jpg" alt="Autistici" width="150" height="150" />#9. Autistici – Temporal Enhancement</strong><br />
Abstract in concept (an exploration of our perception of sound in its relation to time) and in execution (a focus on sounds themselves and their tensions with one another), this album nevertheless also manages to cohere as a compelling and finely wrought listening experience. The second entry on this list from the Dronarivm label, which had a fine year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5224" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Dag-Rosenqvist-150x150.jpg" alt="Dag Rosenqvist" width="150" height="150" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Dag-Rosenqvist-150x150.jpg 150w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Dag-Rosenqvist-300x300.jpg 300w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Dag-Rosenqvist-768x768.jpg 768w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Dag-Rosenqvist-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Dag-Rosenqvist.jpg 1181w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" />#10. Dag Rosenqvist – The Forest Diaries</strong><br />
Rosenqvist had a busy year, but charmed me most with this disarmingly simple set of piano/organ meditations that combine stillness with an undercurrent of dissonance. Notes are allowed to linger and decay, giving time to absorb and reflect. Music for a thoughtful evening.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5241" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Deupree-150x150.jpg" alt="Deupree" width="150" height="150" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Deupree-150x150.jpg 150w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Deupree-300x300.jpg 300w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Deupree.jpg 590w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" />#11. Taylor Deupree and Marcus Fischer – Twine</strong><br />
Another serving of the distinctive kind of microscopic beauty that Deupree’s 12k label has been honing for many years now. Gently hissing tape loops undulate their way softly through time, sparsely dusted with gentle chimes and wobbles, seeping softly into the future.</p>

<p><strong>#12. En – City of Brides</strong><br />
En’s follow up to the excellent Already Gone uses their distinctive palette to good effect. Passages of calmly undulating drones sit in tension with densely layered flurries of sound that reach for a cascading majesty, all heard through a dreamy, blurring filter. A distinctive world to get lost in. Full review<a href="http://musicisgood.org/2015/12/review-city-of-brides-by-en/"> here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>#13 Seckou Keita &#8211; 22 Strings</strong></p>
<p>This album offers elegant, and life-affirming instrumentals by a master kora-player from Senegal, a few of them accompanied by gentle vocals. African and Western sensibilities interweave in the compositions, and the sound is delicate and warmly inviting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>#14 Goldmund &#8211; Sometimes</strong></p>
<p>Another entry in the atmospheric piano miniatures genre, this deeply melodic and contemplative album combines the gentle piano gestures with light electronic washes to create a beautiful sonic landscape that invites introspection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5235" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Port-st-willow-150x150.jpg" alt="Port st willow" width="150" height="150" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Port-st-willow-150x150.jpg 150w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Port-st-willow-300x300.jpg 300w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Port-st-willow.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" />#15. Port St. Willow – Syncope</strong><br />
The instrumentation here is sparse and restrained, the falsetto vocal plaintive. Patient percussion, punctuating flutters of guitar and electronics, and the undulating melodies create an atmosphere that reminds me of late-period, post-pop Talk Talk.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5230" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Ian-William-Craig-150x150.png" alt="Ian William Craig" width="150" height="150" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Ian-William-Craig-150x150.png 150w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Ian-William-Craig-300x300.png 300w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Ian-William-Craig-768x768.png 768w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Ian-William-Craig.png 790w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" />#16. Ian William Craig – Cradle for the Wanting</strong><br />
Ian William Craig has spent several albums doggedly refining an unusual recipe – ambient compositions based on varying kinds of manipulation of his trained tenor voice. Cradle for the Wanting is perhaps the purest installment yet, the haunting, wordless vocals dancing with their own sonic decay.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5223" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Chris-Bissonnette-150x150.jpg" alt="Chris Bissonnette" width="150" height="150" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Chris-Bissonnette-150x150.jpg 150w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Chris-Bissonnette-300x300.jpg 300w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Chris-Bissonnette.jpg 745w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" />#17. Christopher Bissonnette &#8211; Pitch, Paper &amp; Foil</strong><br />
Very much in continuity with last year’s Essays in Idleness, this album continues Bissonnette’s move away from his earlier ambient palette and into his engagement with quavering synth soliloquies. I am left feeling as if it is less a matter of playing music on the synth and more of coaxing the synth into speech, drawing forth a fragile voice from it that sings in its own expressive tongue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5231" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Irisarri-150x150.jpg" alt="Irisarri" width="150" height="150" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Irisarri-150x150.jpg 150w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Irisarri.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" />#18. Rafael Anton Irisarri &#8211; A Fragile Geography</strong><br />
Irisarri’s work is consistently worth listening to, and here as always he achieves a depth of texture and grandness of gesture that lend tremendous weight and presence to his dronescapes. Another important release to add to his growing oeuvre.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5221" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Alva-Noto-150x150.jpg" alt="Alva Noto" width="150" height="150" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Alva-Noto-150x150.jpg 150w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Alva-Noto-300x300.jpg 300w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Alva-Noto.jpg 583w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" />#19. Alva Noto &#8211; Xerrox Vol 3</strong><br />
Xerrox Vol 2 is an album that I admire greatly, and there was a 6-year wait for its successor; I think my ears were therefore too primed for something similar. Xerrox 3 is more sparse and subdued and yet also more overtly emotive. Like all of Carsten Nicolai’s work it exudes precision and care. I suspect it will continue to grow on me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5239" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Vivaldi-150x150.jpg" alt="Vivaldi" width="150" height="150" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Vivaldi-150x150.jpg 150w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Vivaldi-300x300.jpg 300w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-20-of-2015/Vivaldi.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" />#20. Fabio Biondi &#8211; Vivaldi: I concerti dell&#8217;addio</strong><br />
I ended up listening to a lot of Vivaldi this year after learning that his music didn’t have to be played like the Vivaldi I grew up hearing. Fabio Biondi’s versions of Vivaldi are always vibrant, and this new collection has rich texture and the accustomed verve.</p>

<p>The best known Syrian dabke wedding singer, now based in Turkey due to the Syrian civil war, is back with his second studio recording following 147,692 (number approximate) tape releases in his native country.  Souleyman, who uses electronics and his soulful voice to craft fun, incredibly danceable tunes, again worked with Four Tet&#8217;s Kieran Hebden on <em>Bahdeni Nami</em> and the album does not disappoint.  Souleyman&#8217;s lyrics are, of course, in Arabic, so very few native English speakers will be able to understand them, but the sound of his voice blends so well the music&#8217;s high pitched keyboard sounds that their meaning is really irrelevant.  All that matters is the music irresistibly makes hips shake and heads bob.<span id="more-5168"></span></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/the-new-music-friday-3-for-july-24-2015/Mas-Ysa-Seraph.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5169" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/the-new-music-friday-3-for-july-24-2015/Mas-Ysa-Seraph.jpg" alt="Mas Ysa - Seraph" width="280" height="280" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/the-new-music-friday-3-for-july-24-2015/Mas-Ysa-Seraph.jpg 280w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/the-new-music-friday-3-for-july-24-2015/Mas-Ysa-Seraph-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 280px) 100vw, 280px" /></a>Mas Ysa &#8211; <em>Seraph</em></strong></p>
<p>Thomas Arsenault, a/k/a Mas Ysa, is a Canadian electronic musician who uses keyboards and 80&#8217;s drum machine beats to create a stripped back new wave music updated for 2015.  Alternately up tempo and vaguely droning, <em>Seraph</em>, his debut full length, doesn&#8217;t overwhelm the listener with sound, but instead plays with space and mellowness in a manner not common in the genre.  This brings a darkness into the music that separates <em>Seraph</em> from its occasionally punch line inducing forebearers, and creates a fascinating and recommended listen.</p>
<p><a href="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/the-new-music-friday-3-for-july-24-2015/Strange-Wilds-Subjective-Concepts.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5171" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/the-new-music-friday-3-for-july-24-2015/Strange-Wilds-Subjective-Concepts.jpg" alt="Strange Wilds - Subjective Concepts" width="280" height="280" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/the-new-music-friday-3-for-july-24-2015/Strange-Wilds-Subjective-Concepts.jpg 280w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/the-new-music-friday-3-for-july-24-2015/Strange-Wilds-Subjective-Concepts-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 280px) 100vw, 280px" /></a><strong>Strange Wilds &#8211; <em>Subjective Concepts</em></strong></p>
<p>Sub Pop made its name with bands from the Pacific Northwest playing aggressive rock, but over the years they&#8217;ve grown beyond that sound to include everything from Shabazz Palaces&#8217; experimental hip hop to Luluc&#8217;s indie folk.  Strange Wilds is a return to Sub Pop&#8217;s roots.  A power trio from Olympia, Washington, Strange Wilds&#8217; debut LP <em>Subjective Concepts</em> would fit in perfectly with the label&#8217;s 90&#8217;s roster (to the point where the guitar on &#8220;Lost and Found&#8221; sounds lifted directly from &#8220;Smells Like Teen Spirit&#8221;).  Similar in feel to Metz, and made up of roaring guitars and vocals backed by heavy drums and bass, <em>Subjective Concepts</em> is a record made for headbanging and crowdsurfing and is highly recommended for all those lamenting the death of rock.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I didn’t listen to everything this year. Neither did you. I have no objective way of knowing that these are (or are not) the 20 best albums released this year. Neither do you. But these are the ones I most loved and most want to spend more time with next year, and who knows, maybe you’ll find something special here too, something you missed but can connect with and find riches in, something off your usual menu that you might come to be thankful for. If that happens even once, the list will be worthwhile. And as always, if any of the musicians drop by, thank you for the work, care, commitment, and creativity represented below.<span id="more-4679"></span></p>

<strong>#1. Porya Hatami – Shallow</strong><br />
Iran’s Porya Hatami had an enormously productive year – at least eight releases by my count. This was the first and is still my favorite. Hatami takes field recordings, gentle drones, bright chiming flutters of notes, and builds them into an enchanting and unusually well composed ambient symphony that I have been listening to all year without tiring. The irregular patters of sound unfold within an overall structure that creates a sense of focus and development. Just beautiful, a true gift.

<strong>#2. Pjusk – Solstøv</strong><br />
I am an unabashed Pjusk fan, and this pushed <em>Shallow</em> close for the number one slot. Pjusk continue their distinctive weaving of dusk and landscape and luminous pulses and this time add processed trumpet to conjure breath and light in the airy transitions of morning and evening. Glimpse, faded, dawn, bewitching, veil, glow &#8211; the track titles suggest the elusive textures that the music seeks to evoke. Detailed and evocative, the newest Pjusk album is as finely wrought as their back catalog.

<strong>#3. Tord Gustavsen Quartet – Extended Circle</strong><br />
A second entry from Norway, this has been my most played jazz release of 2014. At the heart of it is Gustavsen’s distinctively languid piano playing, weaving innocuous seeming tunes with such a sensitive touch and timing that they float deliciously and linger tenderly in the subconscious.

<strong>#4. Rafael Anton Irisarri – The Unintentional Sea</strong><br />
In some ways the opposite of Christopher Bissonnette’s album in its aesthetic, The Unintentional Sea flows through hazy, grainy curtains of delicately layered sound. Deep trembling tones and hidden crackles and rustles hint at great themes unfolding and give way to melancholy swells of subdued melody. The whole is graceful and sensitive, perfect for times of quiet solitude and reflection.

<strong>#5. Christopher Bissonnette – Essays in Idleness</strong><br />
This one was a delightful surprise, a hugely rewarding departure from the sound of Bissonnette’s enjoyable previous releases. Here he takes a homemade synthesizer and weaves its bright, distinctive sounds into starkly expressive crystalline meditations. The sounds are cold and alien, yet strangely eloquent and human. One of the more distinctive releases of this year. Listen to music from <em>Essays in Idleness </em><a href="https://soundcloud.com/kranky/christopher-bissonnette">here</a>.</p>

<strong>#6. Otto A. Totland &#8211; Piño</strong><br />
Otto Totland&#8217;s reflective piano meditations are familiar to fans of Deaf Center, his recording duo with Erik Skodvin. Here we are treated to a whole album of gently brooding piano compositions, warm and still and human, perfect for a mellow late evening. The sound is intimate, and it is no surprise to find that Nils Frahm had a hand in the recording process. Listen to a track <a href="http://www.sonicpieces.com/sonicpieces019.html">here</a>.</p>

<strong>#7. Janek Schaefer &#8211; Lay-by Lullaby</strong><br />
The early hours of the morning, at the side of the road, drifting, half awake, snatches of static and random radio melodies, cars swishing by, a state between times and places, subtly captured in ghostly, caressing sounds. Deeply evocative. Listen to some tracks <a href="http://www.12k.com/index.php/site/releases/lay-by_lullaby/" class="broken_link">here</a>.</p>

<strong>#8. Loscil &#8211; Sea Island</strong><br />
A welcome return to the core loscil sound, this latest album weaves the characteristic gently hypnotic tones and rhythms around an evocation of the tensions surrounding an island, once home to a Native American tribe, that now houses Vancouver airport and a nature preserve. Beauty, melancholy and an underlying tension combine with the song titles into a thought-provoking implied narrative.

<strong>#9. Chick Corea Trio &#8211; Trilogy </strong><br />
Pianist Corea is joined by bassist Christian McBride and drummer Brian Blade for three CDs filled with scintillating live recordings made around the world. Simply three genuinely virtuoso musicians sounding as if they are enjoying themselves greatly while offering up almost four hours of captivating music.

<strong>#10. Tinariwen &#8211; Emmaar</strong><br />
The throaty vocals, snaking melody lines, and bluesy guitars are all in full force on this latest from the Tuareg maestros, but more than anything it&#8217;s the intricately insistent rhythms that grab me by the ears and make my poor Western body want to move in more than one direction at once. A compelling glimpse into another musical dialect, seasoned with just enough of the West to provide a bridge.

<strong>#11. Ian William Craig &#8211; A Turn of Breath</strong><br />
Billed as &#8220;twelve works for voice and 1/4″ tape&#8221;, the melodic beauty of a trained male tenor duets with a medium that encases it in loops and decays into distortion, creating a broken patchwork through which the vocal melody shines like shafts of sunlight through winter cloud.

<strong>#12. Pascal Savy &#8211; Adrift</strong><br />
This almost feels like a companion album to the Rafael Anton Irisarri release &#8211; ocean-themed, built on finely textured, mysteriously swirling mists of sound with hints of strings, evoking a softly swelling place, numinous, and without horizon. Ominous moments and hints of the chaotic power of the elements resolve ultimately in a quiet disappearance into the fog. Listen <a href="https://eileanrec.bandcamp.com/album/adrift">here</a>.</p>

<strong>#13. Illuha &#8211; Akari</strong><br />
A little more austere in places than their somewhat lusher previous work, this latest from duo Illuha continues their focus on rustling, glistening landscapes of tiny sounds, inviting the listener to slow, to linger, to notice little, fragile shards of light and welcome them in silence. It embodies pleasure in the discovery of small beauties. Listen to a track <a href="http://www.12k.com/index.php/site/releases/akari/">here</a>.</p>

<strong>#14. Thomas Köner &#8211; Tiento de las Nieves</strong><br />
A departure from Köner&#8217;s accustomed arctic wastes of sonic near-absence, this 68 minute piece recalls compositions such as Michael Nyman&#8217;s Decay Music that work by letting single piano gestures decay into stillness instead of sustaining motion by hurrying into one another. Köner adds a focus on bringing deep resonances to the fore, conjuring haunting extended tones from the slide into silence.

<strong>#15. Kate Carr &#8211; The Kakapo </strong><br />
I am cheating slightly with this one, letting it stand for a series reaching back into late 2012. Kate Carr commissioned 12 ambient works for 3&#8243; CD, each focused on a specific bird. Taking us beyond the well-trodden path of random birdsong used to adorn relaxation music, the series yielded an array of fascinating compositions each saying something about a specific feathered creature and our relationship to it. Carr&#8217;s meditation on the kakapo, an endangered flightless parrot, brought the visionary series to a satisfying close.

<strong>#16. Avishai Cohen &#8211; Dark Nights</strong><br />
This album by rising jazz trumpeter Cohen had me hooked from its plaintively bluesy, tensely brooding opening notes. The rest of the album soars and wanders through varying styles and moods, all conveying passion without bluster and an accessible yet rigorous honesty.

The album&#8217;s title suggests states of being rather than stories, and indeed each track by René Margraff focuses more on a particular texture than on constructing movement. As I listen to each hazily droning modulation of noise I find myself thinking of it as the atmosphere of a room in an abandoned building, each with its own space and debris and pattern of dusty sunlight and dim atmosphere.

<strong>#18. Peter Rosendal &#8211; Love for Snail</strong><br />
The title and cover offer clues to the sheer quirky difference of this album, which seems determined to figure out how many diverse ways it can make a catchy tune without losing its sense of offbeat surprise at the fresh sounds that music can make. It&#8217;s jazz of an idiosyncratic, impish bent, and it makes me smile. I couldn&#8217;t find a public stream, but it&#8217;s on the major music services.</p>

<strong>#19. Marcin Wasilewski Trio with Joakim Milder &#8211; Spark of Life</strong><br />
I have been a fan for a while of this trio&#8217;s music and of Wasilewski&#8217;s approach to the piano. This latest release slides more easily into the background than earlier efforts, but contains plenty of beauty when given full attention. I never would have believed that a jazz piano trio treatment of The Police&#8217;s <em>Message in a Bottle</em> would ever be my favorite track on an album&#8230; Listen <a href="http://player.ecmrecords.com/spark-of-life">here</a>.</p>

<strong>#20. Lawrence English &#8211; Wilderness of Mirrors</strong><br />
Exploring sonic territory similar to some of Tim Hecker’s work, English offers here a series of exercises in controlled fury, a measured gusting of swirling noise punctuated with the ominous hum of absence. Finely crafted, dramatic, at some points even awe-inspiring. Listen<a href="https://soundcloud.com/room40/the-liquid-casket?in=room40/sets/lawrence-english-wilderness"> here</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Any list implies criteria, but let&#8217;s eliminate some obvious candidates. This is not a list of the most original, or significant, or skilled, or successful releases of 2013. There is so much that I simply did not listen to that those kinds of judgments are out of reach (for me as for everyone else). Instead, I asked myself: if I were to be separated from my music for a month or two and could only keep 20 albums from my collection with me, all released in 2013, which would I choose? This approach keeps me from adding or skipping things because I somehow feel I ought to. Worthy or not in the ears of the world, this is what I liked most from this year&#8217;s releases. Listen in; who knows, you might like it too.<span id="more-4257"></span></p>

<strong>#1. Nils Frahm – <em>Spaces</em></strong><br />
Any time Nils Frahm releases music I pay attention these days. This year&#8217;s <em>Music for Wobbling</em> wasn&#8217;t my favorite, but in this newest collection, the epic extended version of <em>More</em> (already one of my favorite pieces of music) would alone justify the price of admission &#8211; watch the remarkable <a title="Frahm video" href="http://vimeo.com/78130481">video</a> and see for yourself. After the fragile intimacy of <em>Screws</em>, Spaces puts the range of Frahm’s talent on display in a live setting and makes me long to have been there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">.</span><br />
<img class="alignleft  wp-image-4265" alt="Den Sorte" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Den-Sorte-150x150.jpg" width="120" height="120" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Den-Sorte-150x150.jpg 150w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Den-Sorte.jpg 260w" sizes="(max-width: 120px) 100vw, 120px" /><strong>#2. Den Sorte Skole – <em>Lektion III</em></strong><br />
Quite an amazing achievement, this <a title="Den Sorte Skole" href="http://densorteskole.net/lektion-3/" target="_blank" class="broken_link">free (!!)</a> release is painstakingly and brilliantly constructed from samples taken from hundreds of old vinyl records. Much more than than simply a collage, the result is compelling music in its own right. The 90-minute album offers infectious rhythms, a range of musical styles, and fascinating vocal surprises, adding up to an epic adventure full of delightful twists and turns.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="alignleft  wp-image-4282" alt="Wandermude" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Wandermude-150x150.jpg" width="120" height="120" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Wandermude-150x150.jpg 150w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Wandermude.jpg 280w" sizes="(max-width: 120px) 100vw, 120px" /><strong>#3. Stephan Mathieu &amp; David Sylvian – <em>Wandermüde</em></strong><br />
Selling this as a David Sylvian release confused some listeners, judging by customer reviews; it’s really a Mathieu record. Sylvian’s music is taken as source material and transformed into rich, resonant drones and fragments of melody. The results are deeply absorbing, making this one of Mathieu’s most engaging outings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="alignleft  wp-image-4266" alt="Dysnomia" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Dysnomia-150x150.jpg" width="120" height="120" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Dysnomia-150x150.jpg 150w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Dysnomia.jpg 280w" sizes="(max-width: 120px) 100vw, 120px" /><strong>#4. Dawn of Midi – <em>Dysnomia</em></strong><br />
Built primarily upon gradually shifting rhythmic patterns, this unusual album (think roughly a jazz trio playing Eastern-tinged acoustic techno) works best listened to at one sitting. Slowly but surely it draws me deep into its rhythmic world until sitting still is virtually impossible. A stunning piece of work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>#5. Charles Lloyd – <em>Hagar&#8217;s Song<img class="alignleft  wp-image-4269" alt="Hagar's song" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Hagars-song-150x150.jpg" width="120" height="120" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Hagars-song-150x150.jpg 150w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Hagars-song.jpg 280w" sizes="(max-width: 120px) 100vw, 120px" /></em></strong><br />
Much of the jazz I bought and loved this year was not released in 2013, but <em>Hagar’s Song</em> is an outstanding recording. It marries Lloyd’s distinctive saxophone to Jason Moran’s excellent piano playing. The results are restrained and deep, at once stripped bare and full of presence.  A very varied set, finely recorded and beautifully played.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft  wp-image-4273" alt="Lighthouse" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Lighthouse-150x150.jpg" width="120" height="120" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Lighthouse-150x150.jpg 150w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Lighthouse.jpg 280w" sizes="(max-width: 120px) 100vw, 120px" />#6. Amiina – <em>The Lighthouse Project</em></strong><br />
Recorded during a series of shows performed in Icelandic lighthouses, this is simply a delightful record. Gently plaintive and always beautiful melodies carried by strings, chimes, and a deliciously warbling saw caress the air with musical grace.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">.</span><br />
<img class="alignleft  wp-image-4271" alt="Illuha" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Illuha-150x150.jpg" width="120" height="120" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Illuha-150x150.jpg 150w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Illuha.jpg 280w" sizes="(max-width: 120px) 100vw, 120px" /><strong>#7. Illuha – <em>Interstices</em></strong><br />
Drawing from and walking very closely in the steps of their remarkable and very distinctive debut <em>Shizuku</em>, Illuha offer a live take on their world of small glistering noises and resonances that together give a paradoxically active musical form to sheer peacefulness.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft  wp-image-4263" alt="Chatma" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Chatma-150x150.jpg" width="120" height="120" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Chatma-150x150.jpg 150w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Chatma.jpg 280w" sizes="(max-width: 120px) 100vw, 120px" />#8. Tamikrest – <em>Chatma</em></strong><br />
Like their fellow Tuareg musicians Tinariwen, Tamikrest make a sinuous, bluesy, desert rock music that gradually worms its way under the skin and defies the body to keep still. Alternately driving and pensive, <em>Chatma</em> is an invigorating and life-affirming album.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft  wp-image-4281" alt="Waking Life" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Waking-Life-150x150.jpg" width="120" height="120" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Waking-Life-150x150.jpg 150w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Waking-Life.jpg 280w" sizes="(max-width: 120px) 100vw, 120px" />#9. Andere – <em>Waking Life</em></strong><br />
Two rich, long, cloudy ambient/drone pieces, lightly graced with found sounds, unfold slowly and majestically. It’s a pity this collaboration between Anduin and Radere was not more widely noticed (the more so as proceeds went to charity) – it greatly rewards close listening.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft  wp-image-4274" alt="Liverdelphia" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Liverdelphia-150x150.jpg" width="120" height="120" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Liverdelphia-150x150.jpg 150w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Liverdelphia.jpg 280w" sizes="(max-width: 120px) 100vw, 120px" />#10. Ian Boddy – <em>Liverdelphia</em></strong><br />
Adding to his already considerable output of analog synth sequencing and cosmic swirls, Ian Boddy this year offered up an album that melds recordings from two concerts. This one is gently propulsive, very melodic, and altogether inviting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft  wp-image-4259" alt="Antonymes" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Antonymes-150x150.jpg" width="120" height="120" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Antonymes-150x150.jpg 150w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Antonymes.jpg 280w" sizes="(max-width: 120px) 100vw, 120px" />#11. Antonymes – <em>There Can Be No True Beauty Without Decay</em></strong><br />
Notable for being the fiftieth release from the excellent <em>Hibernate</em> label (be sure to check out their wonderful <a title="We Like Ambient" href="http://hibernaterecordings.bandcamp.com/album/we-like-ambient-curated-by-isnaj-dui" target="_blank" class="broken_link">five-volume sampler</a>, <em>We Like Ambient</em>, released to mark the milestone), this album extends earlier material by Antonymes and offers reworkings by related artists. It further demonstrates his mastery of quietly evocative, piano-led ambient music, with a darker edge here and there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft  wp-image-4261" alt="Blind Theatre" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Blind-Theatre-150x150.jpg" width="120" height="120" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Blind-Theatre-150x150.jpg 150w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Blind-Theatre.jpg 280w" sizes="(max-width: 120px) 100vw, 120px" />#12. Sam Thomas – <em>Blind Theatre</em></strong><br />
This feels less like a collection of songs than like a picaresque journey through a mercurial array of moods and guitar styles that refuses to settle in any one place for very long. By turns playful, aggressive, triumphant, pensive, and exhilarating, this is an album full of joyful surprises that should appeal to fans of early Mike Oldfield.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft  wp-image-4278" alt="Severence" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Severence-150x150.jpg" width="120" height="120" />#13. Severence &#8211; <em>Hidden Ceilings</em></strong><br />
Severence takes gaseous dub techno along the lines of earlier releases by Deadbeat or Pole, and stretches it out even further into the ether. Rhythms are often present mainly as a pulsing implication, while the spacious rush of echoes chasing one another airily around the soundscape is foregrounded. This finely detailed release is definitely one for headphones.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft  wp-image-4297" alt="Winter's Fire" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/top-20-of-2013-david-smith/Winters-Fire-150x150.jpg" width="120" height="120" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/top-20-of-2013-david-smith/Winters-Fire-150x150.jpg 150w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/top-20-of-2013-david-smith/Winters-Fire-300x300.jpg 300w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/top-20-of-2013-david-smith/Winters-Fire.jpg 350w" sizes="(max-width: 120px) 100vw, 120px" />#14. The Ashes of Piemonte – <em>Winter’s Fire</em></strong><br />
A lush ambient meditation on John Milton’s poem about an early modern massacre. Drifting tones and watery field recordings paint hazy pictures of a dim past in the colors of regret and remembrance. Read the full <em>Music is Good</em> review <a title="Review: Winter’s Fire by The Ashes of Piemonte" href="http://musicisgood.org/2013/08/review-winters-fire-by-the-ashes-of-piemonte/" target="_blank">here.</a> Check out also this duo&#8217;s second 2013 release, <a title="Datura Notes" href="http://theashesofpiemonte.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank">Datura Notes</a>.</p>

<p><strong><img class="alignleft  wp-image-4277" alt="Our small ideas" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Our-small-ideas-150x150.jpg" width="120" height="120" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Our-small-ideas-150x150.jpg 150w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Our-small-ideas.jpg 280w" sizes="(max-width: 120px) 100vw, 120px" />#15. The Boats &#8211; <em>Our Small Ideas</em></strong><br />
<em>Our Small Ideas</em> by The Boats is a much expanded reworking of a 200-copy CD release from 2008. This perfectly titled album charms with modest whimsy. If you are drawn by the thought of quaint and quavering sounds, mysterious music boxes found in antique stores, gentle, hesitant melodies that almost seem to ask permission to enter your listening space, and warm, soothing fragility (with the occasional subversive lyric), this is one worth spending time alone with.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>#16. Sav</strong><img class="alignleft  wp-image-4276" alt="Origin" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Origin-150x150.jpg" width="120" height="120" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Origin-150x150.jpg 150w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Origin.jpg 280w" sizes="(max-width: 120px) 100vw, 120px" /><strong>vas Ysatis &amp; Taylor Deupree &#8211; <em>Origin</em></strong><br />
Taylor Deupree’s <em>Faint</em>, appearing right at the end of 2012, has been one of my most-played albums since. To my ear this collaboration with Savvas Ysatis was the best of his multiple releases this year, somehow combining a deep, rich sound with a sense of austere precision and restraint.<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft  wp-image-4267" alt="emptywhale" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/emptywhale-150x150.jpg" width="120" height="120" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/emptywhale-150x150.jpg 150w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/emptywhale.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 120px) 100vw, 120px" />#17. Emptywhale – <em>Some Hollow Lullabies</em></strong><br />
An excellent <a title="Some Hollow Lullabies" href="https://archive.org/details/waag_rel025" target="_blank">free release</a>, this album explores territory quite similar to the Antonymes album mentioned above. Slowly shifting textures, gently evocative piano, and an atmosphere of thoughtful melancholy are skilfully woven together into a patient and beautiful whole.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft  wp-image-4262" alt="Brokeback" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Brokeback-150x150.jpg" width="120" height="120" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Brokeback-150x150.jpg 150w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Brokeback.jpg 280w" sizes="(max-width: 120px) 100vw, 120px" />#18. Brokeback – <em>Brokeback and the Black Rock</em></strong><br />
This took me a while to adjust to – it’s very different from earlier Brokeback releases from (can it be?) a decade ago. Once I could hear it in its own right, I discovered a personable and rather engaging collection of Western-tinged rock instrumentals with a pleasantly intimate feel. One to relax to.</p>

Greg Haines – <em>Where We Were</em></strong><br />
Haines turns his musical gaze from strings to synthesizers, delivering a fascinating recording that joins the elegant, classically tinged ambience of his previous work with stomping beats and cosmic atmospheres.</p>

<p><strong><strong>#20. </strong>Tone Color &#8211;  <em>The Last Day</em></strong></p>
<p>A largely unnoticed <a title="The Last Day" href="https://archive.org/details/ToneColor-TheLastDay" target="_blank">free release</a> on a small netlabel, this debut album broke little new ground, but charmed me with its warm hues, homely environmental sounds, and unassuming, gentle melodies. Comforting and very pleasurable, with some lovely, resonant moments.</p>

<p>To any of these artists who happen to read this, a sincere thank you for sharing your gifts.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>I reviewed <a title="Review: Valta by Alamaailman Vasarat" href="http://musicisgood.org/2012/07/review-valta-by-alamaailman-vasarat/" target="_blank">here</a> the most recent album by Finnish band <a title="Alamaailman Vasarat homepage" href="http://vasarat.com/" target="_blank">Alamaailman Vasarat</a>. Following that review, Stakula, the band&#8217;s leader, kindly agreed to an interview, offering some insights into the processes behind the music.<br />
</em><br />
<strong><em>Valta</em> is an addition to what by now is a substantial body of work, and Alamaailman Vasarat has established a distinctive sound. Has anything changed on this album compared to previous releases?</strong></p>
<p>The most obvious changes were in the lineup. Before the <em>Valta</em> sessions, our new drummer Santeri Saksala had already performed with the band for a year, much to our enjoyment. The live performances really tightened up and had a whole new level of energy. In the <em>Valta</em> sessions, his knowledge and passion for the drums as instruments made a huge difference to album sound, not forgetting some of the most memorable improvised moments, like in the opening track &#8220;Riistomaasiirtäjä&#8221;. His contribution has made a huge impact in the overall sound of the band and we&#8217;re very happy to have him on board.<span id="more-3572"></span></p>
<p>The most difficult move was the second lead change from trombone to trumpet/alto horn in the middle of the <em>Valta</em> sessions, sometime during March 2012. Jarkko Niemelä joined the band with background in classical, jazz and Balkan music &#8211; just a perfect combination of skills for the band. He learned and recorded all the new songs unbelievably quickly and we were able to keep the original release timetable. Now, after performing with Jarkko at several gigs all around, also the older songs have a new life with sparkling trumpet leads. This is certainly a Vasarat version II, so much has changed for the better in a very short time.</p>
<p>To understand <em>Valta</em> better, I need to go back a little bit: <em>Huuro Kolkko</em>, the album before <em>Valta</em>, released in 2009, was a concept piece with a complex storyline going through the whole thing. While interesting way to do music and we&#8217;re most happy with the end result, we didn&#8217;t want to repeat that all over again. But we didn&#8217;t just want to make a random collection of songs either.</p>
<p>So, <em>Valta</em> does have a concept, but it&#8217;s more ideological and less linear. <em>Valta</em> is a musical study about valta (a Finnish word for &#8220;power&#8221;) from several angles. Tyranny is one aspect of it and heavily present in the songs like &#8220;Riistomaasiirtäjä&#8221; and &#8220;Hirmuhallinto&#8221;. More subtle, but ancient power is found in dreams, legends and stories like Henkipatto and Hajakas. There&#8217;s also a lot of emotional power in everyday life of the ordinary people. Their joys and griefs are highlighted in songs like &#8220;Haudankantaja&#8221; and &#8220;Uurnilla&#8221;. But like most Alamaailman Vasarat albums, <em>Valta</em> gives the listener a lot of room to interpret the songs freely, maybe totally differently than what we originally thought. And that is the power of instrumental music.</p>
<p>In our thoughts, we always return to our imaginary country Vasaraasia, (name of our debut album from 2000), and in some way <em>Valta</em> is also the partial history of that place, a combination of short stories about how power has affected Vasaraasian people in the past and today. <em>Valta</em> may also be a prelude to fundamental change in Vasaraasia, maybe a prelude to the next album, we&#8217;ll see!</p>
<p><strong>That combination of having something to say but also leaving listeners to weave their own stories from the music itself is interesting. I get the sense from all of your work to date that on the one hand you like to build ideas around your music, to create stories and conceits that frame the albums, yet on the other hand you sound as if you just take sheer delight in a great tune for its own sake. How does that balance out when you are composing? Do the ideas come before, after, or with the music?</strong></p>
<p>As a long-time fan of movies, sci-fi and fantasy literature, etc. I&#8217;m always thinking about some sort of setting right from the start. It&#8217;s a natural way of composing for me and I suppose other band members may have picked up that technique along the way too, during these past 16 years. When I&#8217;m humming a melody in my head, I picture myself in an imaginary movie, sometimes as the main character, sometimes just an observer. Melody itself may lead to many changes in this imaginary settings and new ideas when it comes to arranging.</p>
<p>Orchestration and arranging are in many ways the most important things in Alamaailman Vasarat music production. All the instruments we have at our disposal are very flexible and we like to experiment with different music styles all the time, often combining them even in the same song. Also, because the music we do is instrumental, we don&#8217;t have to follow that many rules when it comes to song structures. Imaginary settings also free us to think outside the box and let the vision flow. All you need is a strong composition, everything else is open for discussion!</p>
<p><strong>Given what you have said about how you compose, it seems as if video would be a natural medium for you, and there was some video work accompanying some of your earlier pieces. Is that something you plan to explore more in the future?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, we&#8217;ve done some music videos in the past, starting with &#8220;Kebab tai henki!&#8221; which was shot in B&amp;W 8mm in Helsinki and also &#8220;Violence trilogy&#8221;, featuring three music videos shot in B&amp;W 16mm in Prague. All of those were sort of like silent short movies, scored by Alamaailman Vasarat. We even approached the whole projects like movies, starting with a proper script and all.</p>
<p>The funniest thing was when we were making &#8220;Kebab tai henki!&#8221;. The director called me and said that they had some good footage left but the song was too short to fit the footage in. I called Marko, our cellist, and we went to the rehearsal room to compose an additional part for the song. The director was kind of surprised but very pleased! The video got much better and the extra part is now permanently part of the song.</p>
<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/nRr230J4mH8?rel=0" height="315" width="420" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>We&#8217;ve been thinking about doing videos like these more in the future, but it&#8217;s a question of funding and time. We&#8217;re big fans of grainy film which makes these productions much more expensive compared to shooting digital. But we&#8217;ll see, maybe it happens in the future!</p>
<p><strong>Does the emphasis on setting extend to the physical setting in which the music is made? I gather there&#8217;s a story connected with the recent album involving a tower and some wine&#8230;</strong></p>
<p>Yes, recently we&#8217;ve been experimenting with some unusual sound techniques. For the outro of &#8220;Hirmuhallinto&#8221;, the last track of the latest album <em>Valta</em>, I envisioned a water dropper which could act as a rhythmic background for the other instruments. It turned out even better when the band guys built it &#8211; we got a good sound out of a special metallic box which was hit by liquid drops from some four meters up, gradually slowing down as the liquid ran out in a very natural way. After testing, we found out that only using red wine as the liquid gave the right kind of sound. It also really opened up the wine!</p>
<p>Natural, slightly random elements during the recording process may give the music some unexpected and fresh feeling. They will also create great memories and make the sessions more special. I&#8217;m sure we will try these weird techniques out more in the future!</p>
<p><strong>I sense in your compositions and in your comments both a joy in music and a seriousness about music. What would you say music is for? Why is it so important?</strong></p>
<p>Hard question! Well, I don&#8217;t really know if anything is really &#8220;for&#8221; anything, but certainly music has an important role in defining human emotion in an abstract and untouchable way. Yes, it is based on movement of air, but still music triggers something in our minds which is way deeper than just physics or mere numbers. I believe as long as there are random elements in music and the path from a vague musical idea to listener&#8217;s ear is a surprising journey, music will stay important!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last night I was at the Calvin College Fine Arts Center in Grand Rapids, Michigan, for what turned out to be one of the more memorable shows I&#8217;ve ever attended. I was there for <a title="Tinariwen" href="http://www.tinariwen.com/" target="_blank">Tinariwen</a> (on whom more below). I had never heard of the opener, <a title="Kishi Bashi - bandcamp" href="http://kishibashi.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank">Kishi Bashi</a>, not even via the use of his music (as I now learn) in a familiar <a title="Windows 8" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBmtde_XNBs" target="_blank">Windows 8 commercial</a>, and even if I had made the connection I would not have expected his music to be my thing. Support bands you&#8217;ve never heard of are often a bit of a lottery, and as two guys with a violin and a banjo took the stage I was ready for anything, but little expected what followed. Working with an amplified violin, various looping devices, and the assistance for half the set of Mike Savino of <a title="Tall Tall Trees" href="http://www.talltalltrees.com/index5.html" target="_blank">Tall Tall Trees</a> on banjo and bass, Kishi Bashi (real name K. Ishibashi) strung together a series of loop-based pieces that defied genre categorization. He is blessed with formidable skills on the violin, a pure and powerful voice, and apparently boundless energy and musical imagination. Picture Jónsi Birgisson of Sigur Rós singing bluegrass-classical-folk-pop-experimental pieces structured like miniature progressive rock epics interspersed with beatboxing and driven by double-speed loops created live and you&#8217;ll be half way there. <span id="more-3553"></span>Based on a modest amount of post-show listening I&#8217;d have to say the live performance is considerably more dynamic, unpredictable, and downright exciting than the prettier, more polished, but also more subdued studio recordings. There was a constant sense of not knowing what would happen next, but knowing that it would be fascinating, as loops were built and dropped and songs radically changed direction and even genre mid-stream. This video from another performance at NPR gives a good sense of how the show unfolded:</p>
<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/BgqAmZHkkTg" frameborder="0" width="560" height="315"></iframe></p>
<p>I believe this was the first time I&#8217;ve seen the opening act at this venue receive a rapturous standing ovation at the end of their set.</p>
<p>After a brief intermission, Tinariwen took the stage, and I confess I was worried for a while. Take a concert hall mostly filled with American students who have just heard a hip, dynamic, emotive, tech-savvy, show-stealing performance from an upcoming artist whose music is being used to package the future of Windows, throw in the distinct possibility that many of them do not know Tinariwen and came mostly because the flyers for the show said that U2 and Radiohead recommended the band, and then have half a dozen Tuareg dressed for the Sahara walk on stage and stand motionless singing dawdling, alien music in a foreign language &#8211; could that be a recipe for success? Some folk left after the first song, a couple more after the second. Audience response was politely appreciative, but at first visibly more subdued than the wild enthusiasm before the intermission. Little did we know that what we had just heard was just the first glow of a slow-burning fuse.</p>
<p>Tinariwen&#8217;s remarkable story &#8211; the building of a home-made guitar from a tin can and bicycle wire, the Libyan military training, the unlikely rise to international fame &#8211; is easily accessible <a title="Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinariwen" target="_blank">elsewhere</a> and recommended reading.  Knowing and enjoying a couple of their albums did not prepare me for the power of their live performance. With what in hindsight was a masterful sequencing of songs, they imperceptibly built tempo, tension, and energy, and their sinuous, sly rhythms slowly hooked our minds and bodies until they had drawn us over into their world. The percussionist (whom I could have watched for hours) sat with a single drum and conjured complex, seductive beats that seemed to imply a much larger rhythm section. Guitar motifs curled and swayed, never straying far from the weaving pattern but driving the songs insistently onward. By the time, after a few songs, a member of the band danced to the front of the stage, beckoning with body language towards what he did not have the English to describe in words, the crowd was ready; a few stood and swayed, then a few more, and after the piece that followed the entire audience in the all-seating venue was on its feet and in motion for the remainder of the show. The video below gives a sense of the music, but cannot capture the slow, captivating build of energy that occurred as the show progressed:</p>
<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/xrjgKWxBDYQ" frameborder="0" width="420" height="315"></iframe></p>
<p>By the end we were roaring for an encore, and received a courageous one. Moments after one of their most energetic jams, with the audience yelling and whistling for more, a single musician returned to the stage and held everyone, still on their feet, breathless with a slow, pensive, tense solo guitar piece that defied anyone to move a muscle and interrupt its moody progress. The rest of the band returned for a final upbeat flourish, they made a last brief attempt to communicate in French, and we left for home after a remarkable display of the power of music and a taste of the beautiful alchemy of a successful cross-cultural encounter. If you get the chance to see either of these acts live, don’t hesitate.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment_3341" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-3341" title="Valta" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/review-valta-by-alamaailman-vasarat/valta.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/review-valta-by-alamaailman-vasarat/valta.jpg 300w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/review-valta-by-alamaailman-vasarat/valta-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p class="wp-caption-text"><em>Valta</em></p></div>
<p>Slumber takes you, and as time passes, you slip into a vivid dream. You are at a heavy metal concert, and thrill to the first deep and doom-laden, viscerally crunching chords. Then you realize that what you thought were guitarists have morphed into cellists, and as the tempo shifts into double time a saxophone adds a frenetic melody. As you look around you find that you are actually sitting outside a cafe in Eastern Europe, and what started as a metal band is now playing klezmer. Some villagers are dancing &#8211; somehow it doesn&#8217;t strike you as odd that they are dancing the tango, or that evocative middle eastern melodies drop in and out of the tune. You glimpse palm trees, and then hear a jazz ensemble playing somewhere behind you as a marching brass band passes in front, with heavy metal riffs returning to punctuate their melody. But as you turn to watch, you are sitting in the corner of a deserted café in which the pianist is playing his way plaintively towards closing time. In your dream all of this makes sense; the transitions are not jarring but part of an oddly continuous dream logic in which you are in constant movement toward a destination that is ever on the tip of your tongue, yet each passing location is oddly right and vivid.</p>
<p>Such is the experience of listening to an album by Finnish band <a title="Alamaailman Vasarat website" href="http://vasarat.com/" target="_blank">Alamaailman Vasarat</a> (which translates as &#8220;Hammers of the Underworld&#8221;). Alamaailman Vasarat create hugely entertaining instrumental music that draws from a bewildering variety of world music genres and fuses them within a progressive-rock-like inclination towards ever-shifting rhythms and bombastic flourishes.<span id="more-3338"></span> You can see a sample of their work in this live performance of the marvelous track &#8220;Tujuhuju&#8221; from their last album, <em>Huuro Kolkko</em>:</p>
<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/PayjWmZMtXo?rel=0" frameborder="0" width="520" height="315"></iframe></p>
<p>Their latest studio album, <a title="Amazon" href="http://www.amazon.com/Valta/dp/B007YOAY24" target="_blank"><em>Valta</em></a> (“Power”), is newly released. It marks their fifteenth anniversary as a band and offers a worthy continuation of their unusual catalog. Like the band&#8217;s previous albums, this one is a riotous journey through the unlikely, founded in a gleeful disregard of genre boundaries and carried by an unfailing sense of musicality.</p>
<p><em>Valta</em> opens insistently and closes pensively. The opening track, &#8220;Riistomaasiirtäjä&#8221; (<a title="Soundcloud" href="http://soundcloud.com/alamaailman-vasarat/riistomaasiirt-j" target="_blank">listen here</a>) immediately sets things in churning motion, setting out in a style that founding band member Stakula refers to as &#8220;Nu Orleans Street Baroque&#8221;. It plunges the listener into a relentlessly looping brass march that seems destined to repeat endlessly. The effect reminds me a little of the <a title="Youtube" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XChxLGnIwCU" target="_blank">sorcerer&#8217;s apprentice scene</a> in <em>Fantasia</em> &#8211; it shares that sense of something at once triumphant and fateful, gleeful and ominous, an initially confident rhythm that carries within itself the dawning realization that once in motion it may never be possible to escape into rest. A grinding of the gears about a minute and a half into the track offers brief respite, after which a jollier version of the march takes over. This, however, yields with a sense of inevitability to the original relentless drum and brass loop. In the end the only way out is for the tune to lurch lumberingly to a descending halt, like machinery winding down.</p>
<p>The album&#8217;s closing track, &#8220;Hirmuhallinto&#8221; (“Tyranny”), opens with the deceptive promise of a plaintive pump organ meditation before shifting into a gutsy metal chug grounded in the cellos and tubax (Stakula’s trademark specially modified contrabass saxophone; if you don&#8217;t think metal can be done with cellos and sax, take a listen.) As the rhythm lurches into a ponderously propulsive plod, the same plaintive melody repeats in shifting timbres, before things kick up a gear for a more driving middle section. Then we work back through the melody and the metal and are left with a tentative trumpet and a quietly slowing rhythm that gradually peters out to the sound of dripping liquid, ending the album on a rather philosophic note.</p>
<p>Between these bookends, the remainder of the album is a characteristically delightful musical journey, full of unexpected twists and turns. (<a title="Soundcloud" href="http://soundcloud.com/alamaailman-vasarat/hajakas" target="_blank">Listen to &#8220;Hajakas&#8221; here</a>). We wander from frantic double-time to sepulchral groans, from jazzy rhythms to sentimentally lyrical tunes, from snatches of sinuous eastern melody to sudden brass flourishes. Throughout, there is a perpetual sense of motion, with constantly shifting rhythm, timbre, and mood. At times a brief glimpse of one kind of music will momentarily surface in the midst of another, as if there are multiple musical personalities each itching to burst through into the foreground, none willing to be suppressed for very long. One never quite knows what direction things might take next.</p>
<p>All of this might suggest something chaotically thrown together for the sake of parody or novelty value, but that is not the case. True, Alamaailman Vasarat always sound as if they are having great fun, and I find the protean surprises of their carnivalesque compositions repeatedly bringing a smile to my face. It&#8217;s the kind of music that makes one want to keep turning to a companion and saying &#8220;did you hear what they just did?&#8221; It&#8217;s also the kind of music that compels visiting friends to ask what is playing. And yet the music is always tight and coherent, not just a random throwing together of disparate elements. Everything is superbly played, and the sheer pleasure of a good tune carries the listener across many a transition. Amid all the twists and turns, great hooks, infectious rhythms, strong composition and good musicianship carry the day.</p>
<p>If you have enjoyed any of Alamaailman Vasarat&#8217;s previous releases, you will find find fresh reasons to smile in <em>Valta</em>. If you are new to the band, I recommend you take a listen and find out what you&#8217;ve been missing.</p>

<p><em>This is the second and concluding part of an interview with Jayne Amara Ross and Frédéric D. Oberland of the Parisian band FareWell Poetry. Read the first part <a href="http://musicisgood.org/2012/04/interview-farewell-poetry/" title="Interview: FareWell Poetry (Part 1)">here</a>.</em></p>
<p><strong>Jayne, are there any moments in the album where the shape the music has taken added something to your sense of the poetry you had written?</strong></p>
<p>Yes definitely, we try to create pieces where each individual element (the poetry, the music, the films) stand alone but work as a whole also. When we have done a good, thorough job every element should enrich the other. It is only when all the mediums align behind the same very precise objective that you get that feeling of something whole, and enveloping. I wouldn’t, however, rely on the music to give meaning to the poetry or the films. Music is able to sublimate and carry meaning but not to impose it. At its best, it can be the wondrous, intoxicating glue that holds everything together. In all my films, including those that I have made outside FareWell Poetry, music is a really important part and I have always shared a privileged dialogue with the musicians that I have worked with. You can also go really wrong when you add music to film, you can easily trip yourself up by making the wrong choices. Having a close relationship with the composer, and learning to communicate in their ‘language’ can help prevent this.</p>
<p><strong><span id="more-2719"></span>Frédéric, are there ways in which the poetry and film drew the musicians in directions they might not have taken otherwise?</strong></p>
<p>Certainly, there is an evident and necessary connection between the three media used in FareWell Poetry &#8211; poetry, film, music. This interaction is especially clear when we are working on the music for our films/performances like &#8216;As True As Troilus&#8217; (on our first album) or &#8216;The Golden House: For Him I Sought the Woods&#8217; and &#8216;Persephone, A Soft Corpse Comfort&#8217; (on the next). In those cases, Jayne gives us the film&#8217;s scenario to read, written by her before the filming even begins, a scenario that often resembles a poetic text more than a classic film outline, already provided with quite strong mental images, a description of of what is happening in the image, director&#8217;s notes, the &#8220;voice-off&#8221;/narration, etc. We also have an idea of the film format, the duration, whether the film will be in B&amp;W or in color, etc. This first text serves as a guide for the music, a kind of visual and spiritual score, and then among the musicians we improvise, experiment, search for themes and tones, uncover a structure adequate to fit the ideas of the scenario and the different parts and atmospheres of the film. This is the confrontation phase, always passionate; on the one hand the already-written story (often long-cherished by Jayne) and on the other the unleashing of a musical instinct that can veer off in all respects. When we get the first rushes we make selections together from these first musical attempts, we compare everything precisely with the mounted sequences and the spoken poetry, we fix and write down what seems to fit. And we refine the whole as we go along and over the course of rehearsals and performances.</p>
<p>When there is not a film in play, the interaction between poetry and music is not so defined, or at least not as consciously. Of course, the poetry necessarily feeds the music. In Jayne&#8217;s poetry there are often strong metaphors and images that give us broad overall ideas for a piece, or quite specific ones &#8211; the wish for a certain sound, timbre, or rhythm to underline a particular word or poetic image. But I think that belongs to every good song&#8230; Conversely, I think that certain aspects of our music, the colors, the moods, the mental images that it conveys, are also a source of inspiration for Jayne&#8217;s work.</p>

<p><strong>It sounds as if fans of </strong><em><strong>Hoping for the Invisible to Ignite</strong></em><strong> can expect a similar constellation of poetry, film, and music with the next album. Is that right? Are there new directions in the themes or music?</strong></p>
<p><em>Jayne:</em> The next &#8216;big&#8217; film (akin to &#8216;As True As Troilus&#8217; on <em>Hoping For the Invisible to Ignite</em>) will be &#8216;The Golden House: For Him I Sought the Woods&#8217; which I shot last Spring and we began performing the soundtrack live last Summer. When it comes to the films and poetry, the direction or themes are imposed by the content of each piece and then I will try to find a literary coherence that will hold everything together. We would like to make a double album, because we have the material (at least an hour and a half of music and two films) and because we would like to be able to take the time to produce a more intricate offering. &#8216;Hoping for the Invisible to Ignite&#8217; has a sort of simplicity in that everything is expressed in quite a bold, straightforward dichotomy. The next album will be more varied. We would also like to include my film &#8216;Persephone, A Soft Corpse Comfort&#8217; on the album and other spoken word/instrumental pieces that we regularly play onstage and that have a more experimental or modern classical feel to them. The &#8216;post-rock&#8217; appellation only really fits the first album and we will be really happy to get rid of this label!</p>
<p><em>Frédéric: </em>We wanted our first album to have the flavor of a &#8220;manifesto&#8221;, we wanted it to be compact, immediate, flamboyant, to reflect our work and our wishes, without ever thinking about the reception that it might have, about the affiliations or currents to which people might attach us. Even in the studio, we tend to work with our heart more than our intellect. The same constitutive elements will be found in the next album &#8211; music, film, and poetry &#8211; but no doubt interweaving in a different way, perhaps more varied in terms of colors, atmospheres, durations, instruments. There is still a great deal of work and experimenting to be done, even if the majority of the new pieces are in place and certain of them are being tested regularly on stage. We are proceeding a step at a time in terms of the practicalities involved for us in realizing an album &#8211; we usually record the basis of our pieces in quasi-live conditions, but we like to stand back then afterwards to choose the takes, set the arrangements, and mix. The studio is a crucial and delicate phase for us, it&#8217;s not always easy to find the ideal balance between the rigor of the recording process and the spontaneous and fragile side of the alchemy that we are seeking among us and among the various elements that make up our pieces&#8230; The magic, when it&#8217;s there, is never at our beck and call. We will no doubt record in several sessions starting in late spring or early summer; there will be others invited in, friends, and we hope to be surprised and pleased by the result. One must still have chaos within oneself to give birth to a dancing star&#8230;</p>
