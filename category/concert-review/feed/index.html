				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/photo-review-soundset-2015/DSC_04971.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-5096"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5096" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/photo-review-soundset-2015/DSC_04971-300x195.jpg" alt="Vince Staples" width="600" height="389" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/photo-review-soundset-2015/DSC_04971-300x195.jpg 300w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/photo-review-soundset-2015/DSC_04971-1024x664.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p>Saw a lot of live music this year, with well over 100 different bands represented.  These were the best of the bunch:<span id="more-5319"></span></p>
<p class="UFICommentBody _1n4g"><strong>15. <span data-ft="{&quot;tn&quot;:&quot;K&quot;}"><span class="UFICommentBody _1n4g">Wand: November 5, 2015 &#8211; 7th Street Entry</span></span></strong></p>
<p class="UFICommentBody _1n4g">Wand showed up in the Entry and blew the doors off the place.  A technically very talented band, Wand is able to transfer their skills from the studio to the stage better than a vast majority of similar bands.</p>
<p><strong>14. <span data-ft="{&quot;tn&quot;:&quot;K&quot;}"><span class="UFICommentBody _1n4g">Miguel: August 15, 2015 &#8211; State Theater</span></span></strong></p>
<p>Miguel is an incredible performer with magnificent stage presence.  His only real negative is a tendency towards unnecessary, and eye rolling, preachiness.  The show was moved from First Avenue due to a ceiling collapse, otherwise it would likely rank higher.</p>
<p><strong>13. <span data-ft="{&quot;tn&quot;:&quot;K&quot;}"><span class="UFICommentBody _1n4g">White Lung: June 11, 2015 &#8211; 7th Street Entry</span></span></strong></p>
<p>There are few things in this world as invigorating as a truly blazing punk show, and White Lung qualifies.  Mish Way is a banshee of a frontwoman, and the band absolutely crushed it.</p>
<p><strong>12. <span data-ft="{&quot;tn&quot;:&quot;K&quot;}"><span class="UFICommentBody _1n4g">Hot Chip: May 30, 2015 &#8211; First Avenue</span></span></strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s difficult to comprehend the vast number of great songs in Hot Chip&#8217;s catalog until you hear them all at the same time.  It makes for a seriously fun show, especially when capped off by a Springsteen cover.</p>
<p><strong>11. <span data-ft="{&quot;tn&quot;:&quot;K&quot;}"><span class="UFICommentBody _1n4g">TV on the Radio: July 30, 2015 &#8211; First Avenue</span></span></strong></p>
<p>TV on the Radio doesn&#8217;t mess around with gimmicks.  They just take the stage and rock the audience&#8217;s socks off.  In this instance, however, they did close with one of the best of the many &#8216;Purple Rain&#8217; covers played in the Mainroom.</p>
<p><strong>10. <span data-ft="{&quot;tn&quot;:&quot;K&quot;}"><span class="UFICommentBody _1n4g">Vince Staples: December 13, 2015 &#8211; Fine Line</span></span></strong></p>
<p>On <em>Summertime &#8217;06</em>, Vince Staples comes across as a survivor.  He&#8217;s a guy who can grow up surrounded by pain, but make it through.  In concert it becomes clear that in addition to this, he&#8217;s a truly funny guy, and the combination of humor and pain makes for a fascinating show.</p>
<p><strong>9. <span data-ft="{&quot;tn&quot;:&quot;K&quot;}"><span class="UFICommentBody _1n4g">Algiers: June 16, 2015 &#8211; Triple Rock</span></span></strong></p>
<p>Algiers played this show before about 30 people, but you wouldn&#8217;t have known it from their performance.  The energy level was off the charts (especially from bassist Ryan Mahan), which added to the already existing urgency in the band&#8217;s gospel, post punk.</p>
<p><strong>8. <span data-ft="{&quot;tn&quot;:&quot;K&quot;}"><span class="UFICommentBody _1n4g">Titus Andronicus: October 9, 2015 &#8211; Triple Rock</span></span></strong></p>
<p>One of the best rock bands going right now, Titus Andronicus always brings it live, and the TMLT tour was no exception (even if they were distracted by the Mets in the World Series).  A great rock show with a crowd that couldn&#8217;t get enough.</p>
<p><strong>7. <span data-ft="{&quot;tn&quot;:&quot;K&quot;}"><span class="UFICommentBody _1n4g">The Replacements: May 2, 2015 &#8211; The Rave</span></span></strong></p>
<p>A ballroom in Milwaukee is no Midway Stadium filled to bursting, but any opportunity to see Paul Westerberg, Tommy Stinson, and crew play those songs is a gift.  Sadly we might have seen the last of The Mats.</p>
<p><strong>6. <span data-ft="{&quot;tn&quot;:&quot;K&quot;}"><span class="UFICommentBody _1n4g">Big Star&#8217;s Third: September 30, 2015 &#8211; First Avenue</span></span></strong></p>
<p>A performance of Big Star&#8217;s <em>Third</em>, plus the &#8216;hits,&#8217; featuring Big Star&#8217;s Jody Stephenson, The dB&#8217;s Chris Stamey, The Posies&#8217; Ken Stringfellow, R.E.M.&#8217;s Mike Mills, and many, many others. It was an absolute joy to hear this songs live.</p>
<p><strong>5. <span data-ft="{&quot;tn&quot;:&quot;K&quot;}"><span class="UFICommentBody _1n4g">Run the Jewels: October 23, 2015 &#8211; First Avenue</span></span></strong></p>
<p>RtJ has done basically the same show for the last two years, but it doesn&#8217;t matter.  The energy and comradery between Killer Mike and El-P is overwhelming and infectious.  Add that to the fire that is RtJ songs, and it&#8217;s a great night no matter how many times you&#8217;ve seen it.</p>
<p><strong>4. <span data-ft="{&quot;tn&quot;:&quot;K&quot;}"><span class="UFICommentBody _1n4g">Stevie Wonder: March 29, 2015 &#8211; Target Center</span></span></strong></p>
<p>Stevie Wonder brought more than 40 musicians to the stage, including India.Arie, and performed <em>Songs in the Key of Life</em> in its entirety before finishing with some hits, including a show stopping performance of &#8220;Superstition&#8221;.  If it hadn&#8217;t been in an arena this would be #1 by far.</p>
<p><strong>3. <span data-ft="{&quot;tn&quot;:&quot;K&quot;}"><span class="UFICommentBody _1n4g">Kraftwerk: October 7, 2015 &#8211; Northrop</span></span></strong></p>
<p>Four old German guys in funny spandex outfits standing in front of early 80s 3D technology shouldn&#8217;t be great, but it absolutely is.  Then they brought out the robots.  Kraftwerk are true legends and they do what they do very, very well.</p>
<p><strong><span data-ft="{&quot;tn&quot;:&quot;K&quot;}"><span class="UFICommentBody _1n4g">2. Sleater-Kinney: February 14, 2015 &#8211; First Avenue</span></span></strong></p>
<p>They haven&#8217;t lost anything.  Carrie Brownstein still wails on the guitar while doing high kicks, Janet Weiss still crushes the drums, and Corin Tucker&#8217;s voice might be better than ever (she was especially devastating on &#8220;Gimme Love&#8221;).  The crowd was in ecstasy throughout.</p>
<p><strong><span data-ft="{&quot;tn&quot;:&quot;K&quot;}"><span class="UFICommentBody _1n4g">1. Father John Misty: April 4, 2015 &#8211; First Avenue</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span data-ft="{&quot;tn&quot;:&quot;K&quot;}"><span class="UFICommentBody _1n4g">The hype surrounding a Father John Misty live show is immense.  It would be very easy for Josh Tillman to dial it back a bit and still leave the crowd happy, but he refuses to do so.  He puts absolutely everything he has into every note, every gesture, and every word with the crowd.  It&#8217;s a remarkable thing to witness, and if you haven&#8217;t yet done so, you must.<br />

<p>On May 24, 2015, Soundset again brought together a fantastic combo of up and coming artists and hip hop&#8217;s OGs (as well as the genre&#8217;s biggest seller at the moment) for one day in Minnesota.  It&#8217;s remarkable how huge Soundset has become over the last several years (Sway Calloway, on hand once again to host the main stage, even noted without pandering it&#8217;s become the biggest hip hop festival in the world), and this year once again saw a 30,000+ sell out.  Unfortunately, the weather didn&#8217;t cooperate as much as last year with a light rain falling almost all day, but it never fell hard enough to be more than an irritant and the crowd didn&#8217;t really seem to mind too much.  Check below the fold photo highlights, and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.816521411763633.1073741833.198428590239588&#038;type=3&#038;uploaded=48" target="_blank">our Facebook page </a>for more shots.<span id="more-5016"></span></p>

How many of us &#8211; whatever kind of music we listen to &#8211; ever get the chance to hear two of our favourite recent albums performed in their entirety, live, on the same evening, in a single venue? And this as just part of a two-day event with plenty more wonderful music, from brand-new pieces to beloved classics. Bang on a Can came to Dublin, and the weather improved too.<span id="more-4924"></span></p>

<p class="western">“What?&#8230; Wow” was, in festival curator David Lang&#8217;s program note, “made by putting together some of the children and grandchildren and maybe by now even great-grandchildren of composers who happen to live down the street from me, and who changed the world.” So he brought along his Bang on a Can friends Julia Wolfe and Michael Gordon, and the Bang on a Can All-Stars, and So Percussion, and for good measure WNYC Radio&#8217;s John Schaefer, and they met up with a whole bunch of Irish musicians in Dublin&#8217;s National Concert Hall, and the result was&#8230; well, here&#8217;s David Lang again, in an <a href="http://www.irishtimes.com/culture/music/david-lang-minimalism-existed-for-about-a-minute-1.2120463">interview</a> with the <i>Irish Times</i> last week: “I’m going to feel disappointed if somebody comes to this concert and likes everything”.</p>
<p>Hmm. There were 19 pieces of music performed over the two days; I heard all but one, and I really hate to disappoint Mr. Lang but&#8230; Maybe if I&#8217;d been able to get to the first performance, Tom Johnson&#8217;s minimalist classic <i>Nine Bells</i> done by percussionist Olaf Pyras, I might not have liked it, but what are the chances?</p>
<div id="attachment_4930" style="width: 250px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/what-wow-david-langs-festival-of-music-in-dublin/wolfe-e1425840157778.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4930" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/what-wow-david-langs-festival-of-music-in-dublin/wolfe-e1425840157778-292x300.jpg" alt="Julia Wolfe" width="240" height="247" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/what-wow-david-langs-festival-of-music-in-dublin/wolfe-e1425840157778-292x300.jpg 292w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/what-wow-david-langs-festival-of-music-in-dublin/wolfe-e1425840157778-996x1024.jpg 996w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/what-wow-david-langs-festival-of-music-in-dublin/wolfe-e1425840157778.jpg 1225w" sizes="(max-width: 240px) 100vw, 240px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Times,'Times New Roman',serif;">Julia Wolfe</span></span></p></div>
<p class="western">So the festival for me kicked off with my initial reason for going, Julia Wolfe&#8217;s incredible “art-ballad” <i>Steel Hammer,</i>performed, as on the album, by Trio Medieval and the Bang on a Can All-Stars. Seeing it live made me realise I&#8217;d not given much thought to how some of the sounds on the album were produced: that sound evoking a piston engine coming to life? That&#8217;s the band rubbing sheets of sandpaper together. That foot-tapping noise throughout the whole “Characteristics” section? That&#8217;s guitarist Mark Stewart&#8217;s <i>actual feet.</i> And so forth. It was a magnificent performance of a brilliant piece, by superb musicians&#8230; Lord, Lord. I was pleased to be able to thank Julia Wolfe in person. All this went on at the hall&#8217;s Engineering Library (the building was once owned by a university), which I&#8217;d never been in before and which I assumed would be an elegant Victorian room, its walls still lined with ceiling-height bookshelves, a few tall windows allowing the setting sun to cast a warm glow&#8230; well, it did have walls, I&#8217;ll grant you that. The NCH really needs to construct better performance spaces. Or at least get some lads in with a few tins of paint.</p>
<p class="western">Anyway. The <i>other</i> main reason I was there was the European premiere of John Luther Adams&#8217;s big and beautiful orchestral piece <i>Become Ocean,</i> a work that seems to have a better chance than most of making its way into the repertoire. In the main auditorium, the RTÉ National Symphony Orchestra was led by young (23!) English conductor Jamie Phillips, who showed a fine command of proceedings. It&#8217;s a paradoxical piece in a way, because it&#8217;s very carefully structured and symmetrical, yet it relies for its effect on seeming random, like the waves of the ocean. If you had a stopwatch you could easily track the various large and small climaxes, but it&#8217;s so much better to sit back and let these gorgeous swells wash over you. I could have listened all night.</p>
<p class="western">In the interest of brevity, let&#8217;s quickly mention the three other works in that concert: David Lang&#8217;s <i>man made</i> (with So Percussion; satisfying)<i>,</i> Irene Buckley&#8217;s <i>Stórr</i> (inspired by Hebridean church singing; lovely), and Anna Clyne&#8217;s <i>&lt;&lt;Rewind&lt;&lt;</i> (evoking a videotape skipping backwards; amusing).</p>

<p class="western">But I must talk properly about Michael Gordon&#8217;s new piece, which was so new that it was listed on the festival program as “new work” and we were only told its title when the composer spoke just before the Dublin Guitar Quartet gave its premiere. <i>Amplified</i> is what it is, by name and nature. If you&#8217;ve heard last year&#8217;s release of Gordon&#8217;s bassoon piece <i>Rushes</i> then let me simply describe the general feel of it as “like <i>Rushes</i> but with four amplified guitars”. I admit he had to win me over on this one. It was 10.30, the close of a busy day, there was still an hour-long midnight bus journey ahead, and after about a minute of rather harsh-sounding pulses of loud reverb, each player picking out single notes, I feared an hour of noisy tedium. But I closed my eyes and something wonderful happened as I realised that those pulses were travelling from left to right (I was on the right-hand side of the audience) in a continuous wash; that harshness was now something more soothing, though still not an easy ride. It was hypnotic, and I lost track of time; when abruptly the pulses changed &#8211; the guitarists were now in synch and the sound was tumbling forward from them rather than across the performance area &#8211; I reckoned maybe 20 minutes had passed but in hindsight it was probably more like 45. After a while more the reverb began to fall away, and soon we were down to bare picked notes and then&#8230; nothing. For me, <i>Amplified</i> was a valuable lesson in how the impact of a minimalist work can often come from stepping back and appreciating the whole work, rather than (as we usually do with classical) listening from one moment to the next. And also a vivid demonstration of how sometimes it&#8217;s not the actual notes but the sound around the notes that becomes interesting.</p>
<p class="western">And that was just the first day.</p>
<p class="western">Day two began with a Bang on a Can Brunch, which is like a regular brunch but with the founders of a ground-breaking contemporary music organisation sitting in the corner being interviewed. The burger was delicious; the conversation was entertaining. John Schaeffer took the trio through the history of Bang on a Can, and there was time for one question from the audience (I&#8217;m paraphrasing: “Michael Gordon, do you agree with me that <i>Amplified</i> is just a butt-ugly stepchild of Steve Reich&#8217;s <i>Music for 18 Musicians</i>?”). Favourite anecdote: John Cage came to the first Bang on a Can show but left before they played the piece of his they&#8217;d programmed, because “it was past his bedtime”.</p>
<p class="western">So day two was a Bang on a Can Marathon, but David Lang told us we were getting off lightly: just four hours in the afternoon and two that night. Ten works were performed in the first session, the idea being that the audience could come and go as it pleased; I imagine that most of us heard everything, though. Why would you not? So Percussion opened the Marathon with <i>Music for Wood &amp; Strings</i> by Bryce Dessner, who&#8217;s becoming well-enough established as a composer that he soon won&#8217;t need to have “of The National” after his name all the time. The work uses four specially designed instruments resembling hammered dulcimers, and the ultimate sonic effect is that the percussionists sound a lot more like guitarists than you might reasonably expect. It&#8217;s a bitty sort of piece but falls easy on the ear. Chamber Choir Ireland gave us a short and lovely piece for sopranos and altos by the Dane Pelle Gudmundsen-Holmgreen, whose “new simplicity” style fitted well with the festival vibe. The RTÉ ConTempo Quartet (RTÉ is the state broadcaster) were next, with Garrett Sholdice&#8217;s <i>Das Blaue Licht, </i>a nice piece whose first part was entirely pizzicato; the quartet later played George Crumb&#8217;s grotesque/beautiful <i>Black Angels</i> from 1970 &#8211; another work that really benefits from <i>seeing</i> the performance. Bang on a Can All-Stars brought us two strong pieces: Kate Moore&#8217;s <i>Ridgeway</i>, a reflection on home and memory that sounded to me like a ghost parade, and Donnacha Dennehy&#8217;s characteristically punchy <i>Streetwalker.</i></p>

<p class="western">What else? The Crash Ensemble, of course. We heard Seán Clancy&#8217;s <i>14 minutes of music on the subject of greeting cards</i> (a melancholic birth-to-death journey, for piano, violin and flute) and Linda Buckley&#8217;s brand-new <i>Torann</i> (Irish for “noise”, inspired by the sea, an Icelandic volcano, and milking machines), but before those there was Andrew Hamilton&#8217;s <i>Music for people who like art</i>, described a few years ago by an Irish critic as “20 minutes of my life that I will never get back” and by me right now as 20 minutes of something like advertising jingles chopped up and repeated in a hard-driven and unpredictable way for a hilariously unconscionable amount of time, topped with a female voice quoting Ad Reinhardt&#8217;s “Art is Art” statement while also occasionaly screeching, choking and throwing up, that eventually and for no apparent reason transmogrifies into something like a horribly distorted half-remembered version of the Shangri-Las&#8217; “Leader of the Pack”. I have no idea what the composer intended, but I laughed all the way through.</p>
<p class="western">Oh, <i>and</i> Crash&#8217;s pianist Andrew Zolinsky played Meredith Monk&#8217;s <i>St. Petersburg Waltz.</i></p>

<p class="western">Which leaves us with the final concert. Okay, I admit that with Brian Eno&#8217;s <i>Music for Airports</i> (in its Bang on a Can arrangement, of course) I came the closest to not liking, but it wasn&#8217;t the music itself that was the issue &#8211; it&#8217;s just that seeing as the whole point of the music is that it&#8217;s <i>background</i>, it felt at times too incongruous to be sitting in a packed concert hall listening carefully as if this were Brahms. But the All-Stars were great, the first part is a gorgeous thing, and the last featured some wonderful clarinetting from Ken Thomson; Evan Ziporyn&#8217;s contribution to the arrangement takes the music out of the “merely” ambient and turns it into a bona fide concert piece.</p>
<p class="western">And, to cap it all, Steve Reich&#8217;s <i>Music for 18 Musicians.</i> You don&#8217;t need me to tell you the significance of this work, or what it sounds like. All I want to say about the performance is this: imagine Steve Reich&#8217;s <i>Music for 18 Musicians </i>performed by So Percussion and various members of the Bang on a Can All-Stars, Chamber Choir Ireland, and the Crash Ensemble<i>.</i> <i>That&#8217;s</i> how good it was. A triumphant end to a wonderful two days of music-making.</p>

<p>I love live music.  There are few things in this world I enjoy more than going to a show and seeing an artist interpret their music in a live setting, so I get to as many shows as I can.  In 2014 that means I&#8217;ve seen 88 different sets of music (with several more on the calendar before the year changes).  Of those 88 sets, these are the 15 best:</p>
<p><span id="more-4595"></span></p>
<p><strong>#15: Bob Dylan &#8211; 11/4/2014 at the Orpheum Theatre</strong></p>
<p>Bob Dylan doesn&#8217;t care what you want to hear.  He&#8217;s going to play what he wants to play and he&#8217;s earned that right.  At the first of three nights at the Orpheum Theatre, on the day his complete Basement Tapes were released, Dylan and his crack band played 19 songs.  Two were from the &#8217;60s (&#8220;She Belongs to Me&#8221; and &#8220;Blowin&#8217; in the Wind&#8221;), two were from the &#8217;70s (&#8220;Tangled Up in Blue&#8221; and &#8220;Simple Twist of Fate&#8221;), and the rest were released in 1997 and later.  None of the songs played were from the Basement Tapes&#8217; sessions.  It didn&#8217;t matter.  Seeing a true legend play what he wanted to play was an absolute joy.</p>
<p><strong>#14: The Flaming Lips &#8211; 9/14/2014 in the First Avenue Mainroom</strong></p>
<p>The Flaming Lips played the Mainroom twice in the span of two months (also on July 15, 2014).  Both shows included everything you expect from the Lips: Confetti, lights, balloons, weird costumes, and Wayne Coyne in a giant hamster ball.  The September show gets the nod from me as the better of the two, however, because it was at this show that the Lips played their seminal album <em>Transmissions from the Satellite Heart</em> in full.  Many of these songs hadn&#8217;t been played in years, and some had never been performed live.  This fact took the band out of their comfort zone and gave the show an element of danger that doesn&#8217;t exist in the standard Lips show.  It worked.</p>
<p><strong>#13: Chance the Rapper &#8211; 5/25/2014 at Soundset 2014 at Canterbury Park</strong></p>
<p>As much as I love Soundset, hip hop in a live setting can be a let down and that goes double for a festival.  A single MC with a DJ just isn&#8217;t usually enough in that format, and adding hypemen often just gets in the way of the MC.  Chance the Rapper gets around these issues by bringing a full band, including horns.  The live band backing Chance&#8217;s frenetic, left field flow are truly a sight to behold, and I truly hope more hip hop artists develop their live act in similar ways.  In the meantime, if you find yourself at a festival with a Chance set, don&#8217;t miss it.</p>
<p><strong>#12: Tickle Torture &#8211; 8/8/2014 in the First Avenue Mainroom</strong></p>
<p>How to describe this Tickle Torture show?  The gold costumes and crown need to be mentioned.  As does the stripping down to a thong that barely contained the &#8220;D&#8221;.  Can&#8217;t forget the confetti cannons.  Or the guy on the leash wearing only a loincloth.  There were also the scantily clad female dancers.  What else&#8230;oh right, the sex drenched, throbbing R&amp;B that would have had Prince nodding along in the &#8217;80s and would make him blush these days.  Seriously, this new local band is an absolute spectacle, but the music still finds a way to shine through and makes you dance a dirty, dirty dance.</p>
<p><strong>#11: Lizzo &#8211; 1/24/2014 at The Current&#8217;s 9th Birthday in the First Avenue Mainroom</strong></p>
<p>Seeing Lizzo in concert is to witness a force of nature.  That goes for each of the ways you can see her (solo, with GRRRL PRTY, with The Chalice, with Caroline Smith, with Har Mar Superstar, etc., etc., etc.), but at The Current&#8217;s 9th Birthday we got a twofer: Lizzo with Lazerbeak and with GRRRL PRTY.  This meant we had a set jam packed with all her best tunes, and a wonderful night in the Church of Lizzo.  The only negative to the night was the slightly abbreviated set due to the setting.  I could have watched her for hours.</p>
<div id="attachment_4597" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/best-of-2014-craig-mcmanus-top-15-live-shows/Roky-Erickson.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4597 size-medium" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/best-of-2014-craig-mcmanus-top-15-live-shows/Roky-Erickson-300x224.jpg" alt="Roky Erickson" width="300" height="224" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/best-of-2014-craig-mcmanus-top-15-live-shows/Roky-Erickson-300x224.jpg 300w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/best-of-2014-craig-mcmanus-top-15-live-shows/Roky-Erickson-1024x768.jpg 1024w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/best-of-2014-craig-mcmanus-top-15-live-shows/Roky-Erickson.jpg 1136w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Roky Erickson in the First Avenue Mainroom</p></div>
<p><strong>#10: Roky Erickson &amp; the Hounds of Baskerville &#8211; 2/3/2014 in the First Avenue Mainroom</strong></p>
<p>If you&#8217;re unfamiliar with Roky Erickson, now&#8217;s the time to get introduced.  In brief, (very, very, very brief) he was a co-founder of the 13th Floor Elevators, one of the first psychedelic bands, but after years of LSD use coupled with mental illness (and a stint in a hospital for the &#8220;criminally insane&#8221; after he was arrested for having a single joint) he became a recluse.  Recently, though, he has reemerged, and this was his very first performance of any sort in Minnesota.  Quite simply it was the most joyful show I have ever seen.  He&#8217;s clearly still fighting his issues, but everyone in the building from the band to the crowd to Roky himself was so happy to be there that the show became one big love fest.  Truly moving.</p>
<p><strong>#9: Perfect Pussy &#8211; 3/30/2014 in the 7th Street Entry</strong></p>
<p>This is the show that I had the most trouble ranking.  I was anxiously awaiting my first look at this hot new hardcore band and thoroughly enjoyed the 2 opening bands.  Then Perfect Pussy started and were awesome.  Meredith Graves was a banshee, Ray McAndrew prowled the stage like a spitting lion, and the rest of the band made a tremendous racket.  I was just settling in and&#8230;they were done.  The set was slightly more than 15 minutes long, ended really abruptly, and I wasn&#8217;t sure what I thought.  After serious consideration, though, I&#8217;ve decided (obviously) the show was fantastic.  I reached this conclusion after a music friend asked &#8220;knowing what you know now would you have still gone,&#8221; and the answer was a resounding yes.  So go see them, just don&#8217;t expect a long set.</p>
<p><strong>#8: Mogwai &#8211; 5/18/2014 in the First Avenue Mainroom</strong></p>
<p>Earplugs.  If you don&#8217;t wear earplugs when you go to shows you need to start.  I wear <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Etymotic-Research-ETY-Plugs-Protection-Earplugs/dp/B0044DEESS/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&#038;qid=1418056316&#038;sr=8-1&#038;keywords=etymotic+earplugs">these</a> and they are great.  Even if you don&#8217;t start wearing earplugs when you go to shows, you <strong>must</strong> do so if you see Mogwai.  The noise this band puts out in a live setting will rattle your dental fillings.  Mogwai is post rock at its most primal and that translates to their live performances.  There is very little talk, there are (of course) no vocals, and there is nothing soft.  It is pure unadulterated noise rock, and it is amazing.</p>
<p><strong>#7: FKA twigs &#8211; 11/14/2014 at the Fine Line Music Cafe</strong></p>
<p>There have been a lot new female pop/r&amp;B artists over the last couple years and they&#8217;ve been really hit-and-miss in their live performance abilities.  While twigs is more experimental than most of those other new artists, I still had an early concern she wouldn&#8217;t be able to bring it live.  Seeing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYNE1SWvyn8">her performance on The Tonight Show</a> put those concerns to rest and rocketed this show up my anticipated list.  It did not disappoint.  FKA twigs takes center stage with her band in the shadows and uses her history as a dancer to put on a truly artistic performance.  There may not have been any floating sheets of silk, but the performance was just as good as the one she gave Jimmy Fallon.  The next night Prince invited her out to Paisley Park for a show.  Obviously.</p>

<p><strong>#6: The War on Drugs &#8211; 9/22/2014 in the First Avenue Mainroom</strong></p>
<p>It has been a pretty great year for Adam Granduciel.  He put out an album that is nearly universally falling in the top 5 of year end lists (I fully expect that to change when certain MiG authors start posting their lists), and the War on Drugs live show lives up to <em>Lost in the Dream</em>&#8216;s billing.  Granduciel is a true virtuoso with the guitar and the rest of the band has no issue keeping up.  &#8220;Under the Pressure&#8221; in particular took on a new level of hazy brilliance when played live, but every song translates well to the stage, &#8216;beer commercial lead guitar&#8217; or not.</p>
<div id="attachment_4598" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/best-of-2014-craig-mcmanus-top-15-live-shows/HAIM.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4598 size-medium" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/best-of-2014-craig-mcmanus-top-15-live-shows/HAIM-300x225.jpg" alt="HAIM" width="300" height="225" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/best-of-2014-craig-mcmanus-top-15-live-shows/HAIM-300x225.jpg 300w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/best-of-2014-craig-mcmanus-top-15-live-shows/HAIM.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">HAIM in the First Avenue Mainroom</p></div>
<p><strong>#5: HAIM &#8211; 5/19/2014 in the First Avenue Mainroom</strong></p>
<p>It sure took them long enough, but the Haim sisters finally made it to Minnesota on their never ending tour in support of <em>Days are Gone</em>, and they were worth the wait.  The show was tight as a drum with every song being note perfect (well nearly every song.  &#8220;Don&#8217;t Save Me&#8221; had a couple false starts that showed no matter how many times you play a show you can still mess it up now and again).  Sometimes an overly rehearsed show can be a put off, but in this case the sisters&#8217; enthusiasm (real or otherwise) was so infectious it didn&#8217;t matter.  It didn&#8217;t hurt that Este Haim&#8217;s awe at playing the venue where <em>Purple Rain</em> was filmed appeared genuine (nearly every artist mentions this fact, so I&#8217;ve become fairly adept at determining who is telling the truth and who is just fluffing the local crowd).</p>
<p><strong>#4: Paul McCartney &#8211; 8/2/2014 at Target Field</strong></p>
<p>Paul McCartney is 72 years old and played 39 songs over nearly 3 hours.  Of those songs 25 were Beatles songs, which included &#8220;Hey Jude&#8221;, &#8220;Yesterday&#8221;, &#8220;Let it Be&#8221;, and &#8220;Something&#8221;, and he still has the voice to pull this off.  I can&#8217;t really explain the impressiveness of this performance other than to repeat: Paul McCartney is 72 years old and played 39 songs over nearly 3 hours.  Of those songs 25 were Beatles songs, which included &#8220;Hey Jude&#8221;, &#8220;Yesterday&#8221;, &#8220;Let it Be&#8221;, and &#8220;Something&#8221;, and he still has the voice to pull this off.  Go see him while you still can.</p>
<p><strong>#3: Run the Jewels &#8211; 11/20/2014 at the Fine Line Music Cafe</strong></p>
<p>Run the Jewels are the best live hip hop act right now.  Up above where I mentioned hip hop in a live setting can be a disappointment?  Yeah, that doesn&#8217;t apply to Killer Mike and El-P.  These guys are rowdy and raucous and having so much damn fun it&#8217;s impossible to not have fun with them.  The show was so bonkers, in fact, I found myself front and center bouncing around with kids half my age (literally), and I haven&#8217;t done that in ages.  Mike and El are just so infectiously fun there was no other option.  My hands are now permanently &#8220;stuck in a fist and a gun.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>#2: Bob Mould &#8211; 8/31/2014 in the 7th Street Entry</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve had the pleasure of seeing Bob Mould play with his current crack band (Jon Wurster on drums and Jason Narducy on bass) on a few occasions, and they are always great.  That said, I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll ever seem them play a better show than this one.  Announced the day before it was scheduled, the show was in the 250-capacity Entry where Hüsker Dü played many early shows, and Mould made it a throw back show.  The band played 2 headlining sets with nearly all of the second set being Hüsker songs (among them the great &#8220;New Day Rising&#8221;, which I&#8217;ve never heard Mould play before).  The room got so worked up the heat fogged Mould&#8217;s glasses forcing him to remove them and causing an old person squint to read the set list.  Old person or not, he still rocks as hard as ever.</p>

<p><strong>#1: The Replacements &#8211; 9/13/2014 at Midway Stadium</strong></p>
<p>Anyone who knows me knew there was no question what show would be #1 on this list.  The Replacements have long been my favorite band, but I was 13 when they broke up.  Accordingly, when they reunited (yes, I know it&#8217;s only half the band) it was clear I was paying whatever it took to see them when they played locally.  Then they started playing shows at festivals around the country.  Nonetheless, I waited for the local show.  And waited.  And waited.  And waited.  Finally, they announced a show that would essentially close out the minor league stadium a mere 2 miles from my house and I got tickets the second they went on presale.  Joining 14,000 of my closest friends on a Saturday night, I witnessed Paul, Tommy, and couple top notch fill ins play just about everything.  &#8220;Alex Chilton&#8221;, &#8220;Bastards of Young&#8221;, and &#8220;Can&#8217;t Hardly Wait&#8221; of course, but also &#8220;Skyway&#8221;, &#8220;Take Me Down to the Hospital&#8221;, &#8220;Buck Hill&#8221; (!), and especially &#8220;Unsatisfied&#8221;.  I even sang.  I don&#8217;t sing at shows, but these songs left me with no option.  It was pure magic (with just the right amount of Mats mistakes), and it was easily the best show I saw this year.</p>

<p>Once again, Sunday of Memorial Day weekend meant <a href="www.rhymesayers.com" target="_blank" class="broken_link">Rhymesayers Entertainment&#8217;s</a> <a href="http://www.soundsetfestival.com/" target="_blank">Soundset </a>festival at Canterbury Park in Shakopee, Minnesota.  2014 saw Soundset sell out its 30,000 tickets for the first time through advance ticket sales, and the massive crowd was treated to a perfect day of hip hop both with regards to the weather (highs in the upper 70s and partly sunny) and the music (from classics like Nas and Cypress Hill to a fresh from jail Wiz Khalifa).  Head below for a photo review of the day (more photos are available on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.639725556109887.1073741832.198428590239588&#038;type=1" target="_blank">MiG&#8217;s Facebook</a>), and check back in the next couple of days for MiG interviews with Lizzo w/Lazerbeak and Allan Kingdom.</p>
<p><span id="more-4455"></span></p>
<p>The first MC to take the main stage was recent Rhymesayers&#8217; signee, and Twin Cities&#8217; local, <strong>deM atlaS</strong>.  deM atlaS&#8217; <em>Charle Brwn EP</em> was Honorable Mention on my <a href="http://musicisgood.org/2013/12/dispatches-from-funkytown-8-the-top-10-twin-cities-releases-of-2013/" target="_blank">Top Ten Twin Cities Releases of 2013</a>, and is still free/name your own price on <a href="http://dematlas.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank">Bandcamp</a>, so I was excited to get my first live look at him.  Showing off a frenetic stage presence (including smashing a guitar) and an underground rap style/flow, I was not disappointed and can&#8217;t wait to see where he takes his career.</p>
<div id="attachment_4457" style="width: 635px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/auto-draft/DSC06225.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4457 size-full" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/auto-draft/DSC06225-e1401152492799.jpg" alt="" width="625" height="739" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">deM atlaS</p></div>
<div id="attachment_4458" style="width: 635px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/auto-draft/DSC06229.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4458 size-full" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/auto-draft/DSC06229-e1401152568270.jpg" alt="" width="625" height="351" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">deM atlaS</p></div>
<p>After deM atlaS I headed over to the smaller Fifth Element Tent (unfortunately missing Ab Soul on the main stage), and caught the tail end of a set by <strong>Ecid</strong>.  I&#8217;m always impressed by folks who can ably perform as both electronic DJ and MC, and what little I saw of Ecid convinced me I need to explore further.  Initial investigation shows me he has a number of releases up on <a href="http://ecid.bandcamp.com/album/post-euphoria-vol-1-2-deluxe" target="_blank">Bandcamp</a>.</p>
<div id="attachment_4459" style="width: 635px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/auto-draft/DSC06278.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4459 size-full" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/auto-draft/DSC06278-e1401152684629.jpg" alt="" width="625" height="939" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Ecid</p></div>
<p><strong>K. Raydio &amp; Psymun</strong> are a Twin Cities duo who use Psymun&#8217;s vaguely ambient beats and K. Raydio&#8217;s sultry vocals to create R&amp;B/hip hop accurately described as &#8216;lovely&#8217;.  Their debut album, <em><a href="http://kraydioandpsymun.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank">LucidDreamingSkylines </a></em>is available for streaming/purchase on Bandcamp, and I don&#8217;t know how I&#8217;m going to write the rest of this review because I want to do nothing more than shut my eyes and let it wash over me again and again.</p>
<div id="attachment_4460" style="width: 635px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-4460 size-full" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/auto-draft/DSC06317-e1401152755206.jpg" alt="" width="625" height="416" /><p class="wp-caption-text">K.

<div id="attachment_4461" style="width: 635px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/auto-draft/DSC06322.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4461 size-full" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/auto-draft/DSC06322-e1401152858990.jpg" alt="" width="625" height="820" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">K. Raydio &amp; Psymun</p></div>
<p>I&#8217;d heard of Seattle&#8217;s <strong>Nacho Picasso</strong>, but had no idea was I was in for when he took the stage.  Nacho is funny, dark, energetic, drenched in weed, and a great live performer.  Again, he has a number of releases on <a href="http://nachopicasso.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank">Bandcamp</a>.</p>
<div id="attachment_4462" style="width: 635px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/auto-draft/DSC06388.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4462 size-full" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/auto-draft/DSC06388-e1401152932860.jpg" alt="" width="625" height="456" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Nacho Picasso</p></div>

<p>The main reason I hit up the Fifth Element Tent was to catch <strong>Allan Kingdom</strong>&#8216;s set before our interview.  I&#8217;ll have more on him when the interview posts, but for now, go download everything he has on <a href="http://allankingdomforever.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank">Bandcamp </a>(especially <em>Talk to Strangers</em>) and enjoy.</p>

<p>Back to the main stage for another recent Rhymesayers&#8217; signee, <strong>Prof</strong>.  I&#8217;ve said it before, I&#8217;m not the biggest fan of <em><a href="http://profstophouse.bandcamp.com/album/king-gampo" target="_blank">King Gampo</a></em>, but there is no denying he puts on an amazing live performance and I look forward to every opportunity I have to experience it.  I recommend catching him whenever/wherever you can, but especially in a festival atmosphere where the crowd can fully get into the show.</p>
<div id="attachment_4466" style="width: 635px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/auto-draft/DSC06499.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4466 size-full" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/auto-draft/DSC06499-e1401153759189.jpg" alt="" width="625" height="238" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Crowd</p></div>

<p>When the Soundset lineup was announced there were a couple names that jumped out at me and <strong>Chance the Rapper</strong> was right at the top of that group.  <em>Acid Rap</em> was my <a href="http://musicisgood.org/2013/12/top-20-of-2013-craig-mcmanus/" target="_blank">#3 album of 2013</a> and the fact he is touring with a live band (I&#8217;m an absolute sucker for live band hip hop) made his set an absolute can&#8217;t miss.  Not only did he not disappoint, but Chance the Rapper was without a doubt the set of the day.</p>
<div id="attachment_4470" style="width: 635px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/auto-draft/DSC06576.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4470 size-full" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/auto-draft/DSC06576-e1401154022636.jpg" alt="" width="625" height="432" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Chance the Rapper</p></div>
<div id="attachment_4471" style="width: 635px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/auto-draft/DSC06618.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4471 size-full" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/auto-draft/DSC06618-e1401154071752.jpg" alt="" width="625" height="771" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Chance the Rapper</p></div>
<p>The Odd Future crew is known for their anything goes attitude and live shows that can deteriorate to anything from violence to misogyny.  So it was anyone&#8217;s guess as to what would happen when Tyler the Creator and Earl Sweatshirt took the stage in their <strong>Earl Wolf</strong> configuration.  What we got was (other than some insulting Tyler comments to a female in the crowd) a pretty straight forward rap show.</p>
<div id="attachment_4472" style="width: 635px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/auto-draft/DSC06656.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4472 size-full" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/auto-draft/DSC06656-e1401154136603.jpg" alt="" width="625" height="416" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Earl Wolf</p></div>

<p>Up next: <strong>Cypress Hill</strong>.  It&#8217;s hard for me to review their performance because it was such an honor for me to take pictures of a group as groundbreaking as them.  I just kept having flashbacks to listening to &#8220;Insane in the Brain&#8221; when I was in high school.  Unfortunately a large amount of the crowd was too young to realize the royalty they were witnessing and tuned out.  Their loss.</p>

<p>There was no concern the crowd would tune out <strong>2 Chainz</strong>.  There had been rumors earlier in the day that Tity Boi was a no show, but when his set time came around he showed up in every sense of the word.  2 Chainz is another artist that hasn&#8217;t quite reached me on tape (other than &#8220;Feds Watching&#8221; of course, which is a crazy great track), but I see now what the fuss is about.  A ridiculously fun set.</p>

<p>I mentioned it was hard to properly review Cypress Hill.  Well, it&#8217;s impossible for me to review <strong>Nas</strong> doing <em>Illmatic</em> in full.  Amazing.</p>

<p>On Saturday, <strong>Wiz Khalifa</strong> was <a href="http://pitchfork.com/news/55320-wiz-khalifa-arrested-for-pot-possession/" target="_blank">arrested for possession of marijuana in Texas</a> (the same spot Fiona Apple, Willie Nelson, and Snoop have been arrested&#8230;seriously musicians don&#8217;t have pot there!), so there was serious concern he wouldn&#8217;t make it to Minnesota after spending the night in jail.  No concern was necessary.  Trap Wiz was released, hopped a private plane, and made it with time to spare.  Anyone who smuggled in some pot and hadn&#8217;t used it up already, did so when he took the stage (including an unrepentant Wiz himself) for another manic performance.</p>

<p>After ceding their spot to Snoop Dogg last year, <strong>Atmosphere</strong> returned to their traditional headlining set for 2014.  I honestly don&#8217;t know what to say about Atmosphere live performances anymore, other than to reiterate that if you haven&#8217;t seen them before you must rectify that fact as soon as possible.  Slug is absolutely amazing live rapper (the faces he makes are truly glorious) and when he is joined by Brother Ali like he was for &#8220;Cats Van Bags&#8221;&#8230;well&#8230;that&#8217;s just too much awesomeness for one stage.</p>

<p>Indie pop band Lucius has been on a long tour in support of their debut album <em>Wildewoman</em>, which has brought them to the Twin Cities on a couple different occasions (if they perform near you&#8230;GO).  This trip through they are playing a sold out show at The Cedar this evening, but found time this afternoon to stop by The Current for an in studio performance in Minnesota Public Radio&#8217;s UBS Forum.  I was lucky enough to get to go and I brought my camera.  More photos are available on MiG&#8217;s <a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.593635104052266.1073741827.198428590239588&#038;type=3&#038;uploaded=25">Facebook</a> page.<span id="more-4369"></span></p>

<p>There are only a few things in this world I love more than seeing live music.  I&#8217;ve actually kept a list of every artist I&#8217;ve ever seen (the first entry is for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dino_%28singer%29" target="_blank">Dino</a>), along with a grade for the performance and a few words about the show.  While I don&#8217;t get to as many shows as I&#8217;d like, I was able to see 48 different sets by 46 different artists in 2013.  So I thought I&#8217;d give a Top 5 live performances for this year.</p>
<p>Before getting into the Top 5, though, here are some other performances that I want to highlight:<span id="more-4328"></span></p>
<p>Oddest Venue &#8211; <strong>Dan Deacon</strong> at the Walker Art Center on June 15, 2013: Deacon was scheduled to kick off the music for <a href="http://www.thecurrent.org/" target="_blank">The Current</a> and <a href="http://www.walkerart.org/" target="_blank">Walker Art Center&#8217;s</a> annual Rock the Garden.  Just before showtime, however, a massive thunderstorm rolled through and the scheduled start time was pushed back while most of the crowd took shelter in the Walker&#8217;s underground parking garage.  Dan Deacon&#8217;s a chill dude, though, and he decided to keep the concert on schedule by shifting his equipment to the garage and throwing a parking lot dance party.  The sound was terrible (obviously), but it was still one of the coolest shows I&#8217;ve ever witnessed, and there is some video via <a href="http://pitchfork.com/" target="_blank">Pitchfork</a>:</p>

<p>Oddest Crowd &#8211; <strong>Jimmy Cliff</strong> at First Avenue on September 19, 2013: Jimmy Cliff is one of only two reggae artists in the &#8220;Rock and Roll Hall of Fame&#8221; (obviously Bob Marley is the other), and this fact led to an incredibly odd mixture of people at his First Avenue performance.  I saw quite a few of the usual folks I see there: college kids, hipsters, and music nerds like myself.  Added to these, however, were guys whose hair had turned gray (at least the hair they still had), but they were still rocking the pony tail, a large number of white people drinking Red Stripe, and more tie dye than should be legal.  I found myself down front next to two couples who spent the night reminiscing about their hippie days and complaining about it being hard to find good pot anymore.  It was weird.  Jimmy&#8217;s still got it, though.</p>
<p>Most Intriguing Opening Act &#8211; <strong>Twin Peaks</strong> at First Avenue on July 29, 2013: I&#8217;d never heard of Twin Peaks before seeing them open for Foxygen, but I have a feeling I&#8217;ll be seeing their name again.  They are an incredibly young band out of Chicago who have obviously been heavily influenced by early Replacements, and to put it simply they are a lot of fun.  It&#8217;s rare to see a First Avenue crowd actually getting into an opening act, but the energy Twin Peaks brought to the stage was so infectious they won over everyone who got there early enough to see them.  It&#8217;s a good thing too, because&#8230;</p>
<p>Shortest Performance &#8211; <strong>Foxygen</strong> at First Avenue on July 29, 2013: Foxygen took the stage playing &#8220;On Blue Mountain&#8221;.  Halfway through the song, frontman Sam France hopped up on a monitor that tipped over dumping him into the barrier in front of the crowd.  France immediately stopped singing and the First Avenue staff scrambled for help while the band finished playing the song (a crowd member did grab the mic and sing a few lines).  Soon the paramedics arrived and France was removed on a stretcher.  Turns out he suffered complete fractures of both his tibia and fibula and had to undergo surgery the next day.</p>
<p>Most &#8216;Controversial&#8217; &#8211; <strong>Low</strong> at the Walker Art Center on June 15, 2013: Despite Dan Deacon&#8217;s best efforts to keep Rock the Garden on schedule, removing standing water from the stage pushed Low&#8217;s set back a bit and shortened it substantially.  Accordingly, the band decided to try something new: They played a single drone version of &#8220;Do You Know How to Waltz&#8221; for just under a half hour.  For the first few minutes I was confused by the performance (they didn&#8217;t say anything about what was about to happen before starting), but after awhile I realized what was going on and absolutely loved it.  Many did not, however, as commenters on <a href="http://blog.thecurrent.org/2013/06/the-audacity-of-low-what-does-a-band-owe-us-when-we-pay-to-see-them-perform/" target="_blank">this</a> article at The Current make clear (you can, and should, also hear the entire performance at that link).</p>
<p>Worst Refund &#8211; <strong>Kanye West</strong> (scheduled) at Target Center on November 5, 2013:  <em>Yeezus</em> was supposed to make an appearance in town and I had tickets.  Then his equipment truck was in an accident and the date was pushed back.  Later it was cancelled outright because <del>ticket sales were a little soft </del>they couldn&#8217;t find a new date that would work.  This is the third consecutive time Kanye has cancelled a scheduled Twin Cities date.  I&#8217;m beginning to see a trend.</p>
<p>Top 5</p>
<p>5. <strong>Mike Doughty: M. Doughty (Used To Be in) Soul Coughing</strong> at First Avenue on October 25, 2013: I saw Soul Coughing at First Avenue in 1996 and that performance is in my all-time top 5.  For years, however, Mike Doughty has refused to play Soul Coughing songs, and reading his book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Book-Drugs-A-Memoir/dp/0306818779/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&#038;qid=1387561393&#038;sr=8-1&#038;keywords=book+of+drugs" target="_blank"><em>The Book of Drugs: A Memoir</em></a>, made it pretty clear why.  Apparently, though, writing the book proved cathartic and this year M. Doughty hit the road playing nothing but Soul Coughing tunes.  My anticipation for this show was off the charts, and I freely admit that my love for the songs may have clouded my judgment of the performance, but he played absolutely everything and it sounded gooooood.  Starting with &#8220;Is Chicago, Is Not Chicago&#8221; and &#8220;Sugar Free Jazz&#8221; and finishing up with &#8220;Super Bon Bon&#8221; and &#8220;Circles&#8221;, it was a fantastic night of nostalgia and great music.</p>
<p>4. <strong>Jay Z</strong> at Xcel Energy Center on November 30, 2013: I was very nervous about this show coming off Kanye&#8217;s cancellation, hearing that ticket sales weren&#8217;t great, and the fact that the opening &#8216;act&#8217; was a prerecorded DJ set, but I didn&#8217;t need to worry.  Jay Z is a pro with a ridiculous list of hits, and he absolutely brought it and seemed to be sincerely enjoying himself. He mentioned at a couple points that he regretted &#8220;sleeping on&#8221; St. Paul, thinking we&#8217;d get up for the hits but nothing else. It was a comment much different than the usual ego stroking of the locals, because he straight up admitted St. Paul had won respect it didn&#8217;t have previously.  It&#8217;s really an insult, because it goes back to the stupid coastal &#8216;flyover state&#8217; mentality, but at least he was willing to admit he was wrong. The only real negative of the show was that he turned over 10 minutes of his set (when he completely left the stage) to Timbaland who was his DJ. Timba just played some of the famous beats he&#8217;s written, and generally bored the crowd (other than when he built a beat via beat boxing, which I&#8217;ll never tire of seeing someone do). It almost wrecked the show, but when you can return from the break with &#8220;Somewhere in America&#8221;/&#8221;Big Pimpin'&#8221;/&#8221;Dirt Off Your Shoulder&#8221; it gets the crowd right back into it just a bit.</p>
<p>3. <strong>D&#8217;Angelo &amp; Questlove: Brothers in Arms</strong> at First Avenue on June 23, 2013: Good friends D&#8217;Angelo and Questlove got together to play three &#8220;Brothers in Arms&#8221; shows and Minneapolis was lucky enough to get one of them (NYC and Philly had the other two).  D&#8217;Angelo hadn&#8217;t played the Twin Cities in over a decade, so the crowd was more than ready when they took the stage and explained that basically they were going to be jamming like they do in the studio and playing songs they love.  The only difference with the studio was that this time there would be an audience. For most of the show it was just the two of them on stage with Questlove wearing a mic to D&#8217;s earpiece allowing him to lead.  Things kicked off with &#8220;Brown Sugar&#8221; and then went for two hours (a mixture of D&#8217;Angelo&#8217;s originals and covers, including Prince (obviously), the Ohio Players, Sly, Terrance Trent Darby, J Dilla). The entire 2 hours was nonstop soul, funk, and R&amp;B jams with the last 20 minutes seeing them joined by some Minneapolis Sound session players on bass and sax and the lead singer of Mint Condition for a seriously James Brownesque showstopper.  Both Questo and D showed why they are at the top of their field and put on a show so fantastic, I&#8217;m just guessing there were a few babies made that night around the Twin Cities.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Savages</strong> at Triple Rock Social Club on July 21, 2013: I still can&#8217;t get over how great this show was, but I&#8217;m not going to write any more than <a href="http://musicisgood.org/2013/07/concert-review-savages-at-the-triple-rock-social-club/" target="_blank">I already did</a>.</p>
<p>1. <strong>Prince &amp; 3rdeyegirl</strong> at the Dakota on January 18, 2013: Another one I still can&#8217;t get over, but <a href="http://musicisgood.org/2013/01/dispatches-from-funkytown-6-prince-lives-here-weve-got-10000-lakes/" target="_blank">won&#8217;t write more about</a>.  I actually got to witness the debut performance of a new Prince backing band.  Amazing.</p>

<p>Every year the Twin Cities benefits from Pitchfork Music Festival being in Chicago when several of the bands add a stop on their way to or from Chicago.  This year that meant the first local date for the ferocious post punk buzz band of the moment Savages.</p>
<p>The show was at the 400 person capacity Triple Rock Social Club in Minneapolis, and sold out so quickly (despite shows at the Triple Rock selling out rarely enough that a sign on the door announced &#8220;Tonight&#8217;s show is completely sold out.  Seriously.&#8221;) that a return date has already been added at the 1,500 capacity First Avenue Mainroom in September.  If you read nothing else of this review, read this: See them now before the rooms get even bigger.<span id="more-4163"></span></p>
<p>Opening for the band was <strong>Johnny Hostile</strong>, Savages&#8217; producer, co-founder, with Savages&#8217; lead singer Jehnny Beth, of their Pop Noire label, and longtime boyfriend of Beth.  Going in, I was expected experimental Frenchman with a guitar, but what I got was a much, much darker experimental Frenchman with a bass and drum machine.  Far too often opening acts can get lost in the noise of late arriving crowds, but that was not a concern in this case.  Hostile takes the low end darkness of the Factory bands and adds vocals reminiscent of <em>Red Mecca</em> era Cabaret Voltaire to create a pulsing doom that utterly filled the small room.  More importantly, though, his sound was the rare instance where an opening act actually felt a part of the show as a whole and was the perfect mood setter for what was to come.  The only real issue was the lack of variation in sound (even with being joined by Savages&#8217; guitarist Gemma Thompson for one song and Jehnny Beth for another) causing a bit of monotony towards the end of the set.  At only about a half hour, though, this is a minor quibble.</p>
<p>From the moment Johnny Hostile finished, the anticipatory tension in the room started to ramp up (aided largely by the constant feedback that ebbed and flowed throughout the break) for the band that has received nothing but rave reviews for their live performance.  <strong>Savages</strong> did not disappoint.  The word that kept running through my mind during the set was <em>visceral</em>.  All four women (who are even more petite than I realized.  Seriously, I&#8217;m six feet tall and when drummer Fay Milton walked by me prior to the show she barely came up to my chest) came out in black and absolutely pummeled the audience with sound.  Jehnny Beth prowled the stage staring down the audience in a half crouch (aided by a microphone stand set between 6&#8243; and a foot lower than her full height) as if daring anyone to take their eyes off her.  Some in the audience were a little too into her and stuck their phones directly into her face, despite the quickly becoming ubiquitous sign asking people to keep their phones in their pockets.  The first violators simply got their phones slapped down.  The last saw Jehnny Beth take it and flip it behind her on stage (the phone&#8217;s owner did get it back after the show).  Meanwhile, Thompson, Milton, and bassist Ayşe Hassan put their heads down and thundered at their instruments.  It was post punk, both musically and visually, at its absolute finest.  The set was short (about an hour) and mostly came from <em>Silence Yourself</em>, but was so powerful I don&#8217;t know that the audience could have taken much more.  &#8220;She Will&#8221; in particular was an absolute highlight.  Perhaps my favorite moment, however, came at the end when the band refused to engage in the &#8216;encore&#8217; farce.  Savages took the stage, played their 12 song set ending with &#8220;Husbands&#8221;, and were done.  It was wonderful, even if the crowd was a little confused at the lack of an &#8216;encore&#8217;.</p>
<p>Savages is a band that seriously lived up to the hype, and I can&#8217;t recommend seeing them more highly.  There is a very good chance I&#8217;ll be in the audience again in September.</p>

<p>Memorial Day weekend in the Twin Cities brings independent hip hop label <a href="http://www.rhymesayers.com/">Rhymesayers Entertainment&#8217;s</a> <a href="http://www.soundsetfestival.com/">Soundset</a> festival to Canterbury Park in Shakopee.  This year&#8217;s festival promised to be the largest yet with headlining act Snoop Dogg supported by Rhymesayers&#8217; artists Atmosphere, Brother Ali, Aesop Rock, and P.O.S, plus national acts Mac Miller, Tech N9ne, Juicy J, and Schoolboy Q among others.  Also on the bill was the great Busta Rhymes, but for reasons as yet unexplained, Busta did not show for the festival.  Neither that disappointment nor the unseasonably cool weather and strong winds, though, failed to dampen the spirits of the 28,000+ hip hop fans who turned out for the show.<span id="more-4102"></span></p>
<p>After last year&#8217;s festival, I posted a <a href="http://musicisgood.org/2012/05/concert-review-soundset-2012/">full review</a> of each of the artists I was able to catch.  This year, however, I was fortunate enough to obtain a photo media pass, so I wasn&#8217;t able to fully focus on the performances themselves.  Instead, I present to MiG readers, Soundset 2013 in pictures (a few are below, but <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=466290593453385&#038;set=a.466290503453394.1073741825.198428590239588&#038;type=3&#038;src=https%3A%2F%2Ffbcdn-sphotos-g-a.akamaihd.net%2Fhphotos-ak-prn1%2F941630_466290593453385_665646131_n.jpg&#038;size=960%2C639">MiG&#8217;s Facebook page</a> has substantially more):</p>

<p>As Atmosphere noted in their song &#8220;Shhh&#8221;, there isn&#8217;t a lot to brag about in Minnesota.  It&#8217;s cold, there aren&#8217;t really any tourist destinations (sorry <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:MplsMTMstatue.jpg" target="_blank" class="broken_link">Mary Tyler Moore statue</a>) and the popular sports teams are varying levels of terrible.  One thing we do have, though, is the Purple Yoda himself: Prince.  Prince Rogers Nelson was born in Minneapolis and while he has lived outside the state, Minnesota has always been his home.  That said, Prince hasn&#8217;t performed in Minnesota since a run of three shows at various venues in 2007.<span id="more-3931"></span></p>
<p>On the morning of Tuesday, January 15, 2013, however, Prince announced a run of six &#8216;rehearsal&#8217; shows at the <a href="http://dakotacooks.com/" target="_blank">Dakota Jazz Club &amp; Restaurant</a> in downtown Minneapolis.  The Dakota is a small jazz venue that seats less than 300, so it was initially a surprise that Prince would hold the concerts there rather than his home base at Paisley Park.  Turns out, the band fun. is starting a tour in St. Paul on the 23rd and had rented out Paisley Park as their rehearsal space.  So Prince decided to move his rehearsals to another location, but being Prince he couldn&#8217;t let that be the only curve ball he through his fans.  Jaws really dropped when folks learned that the six shows would be over three nights (shows at 8:00 p.m. and 11:00 p.m. each day), each night would have a different theme, and the shows were scheduled for the next three nights: Wednesday the 16th through Friday the 18th.  The shows were broken down as follows:</p>
<p>Wednesday, January 16, 2013, &#8220;Soundcheck&#8221;: Prince auditioning a new drummer and performing improvised music.  Gimme Noise&#8217;s review can be found <a href="http://blogs.citypages.com/gimmenoise/2013/01/prince_at_dakota_jazz_club_1_16_13.php" target="_blank" class="broken_link">here</a>.</p>
<p>Thursday, January 17, 2013, &#8220;Jam!!!&#8221;: Prince and the band playing an after party vibe.  The Current&#8217;s review is <a href="http://blog.thecurrent.org/2013/01/prince-dakota-jazz-club-night-2/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>Friday, January 18, 2013, &#8220;Surprise!! (don&#8217;t miss this)&#8221;: It&#8217;s a surprise, so who knows what is going to happen.  I have serious doubts that even Prince knew initially what he wanted to do at these shows.</p>
<p>Tickets to all shows went on sale on Tuesday, and I was able to navigate the music world&#8217;s destruction of the Dakota&#8217;s ticket buying website to secure tickets to the Friday Surprise 8:00 show.</p>
<p>As the week went on, speculation was rampant about what the surprise would be, with the popular assumption being that Prince would unveil an all female backing band.  Some, were <a href="http://blogs.citypages.com/gimmenoise/2013/01/7_possible_prince_surprises.php#more" target="_blank" class="broken_link">hoping for something crazier</a> though, including <a href="http://www.thecurrent.org/">Current</a> host Mary Lucia who noted that with Prince &#8220;god only knows who will show up, he could unearth the body of James Brown&#8221;.  When Prince took the stage it was clear that the rumors were correct as he was joined in a traditional rock quartet by three females: Donna on guitar; Ida on bass; and Hannah on drums.  As we know with Prince, he likes the women around him to be young and gorgeous and these three certainly qualify.  We also know, though, that he&#8217;s not going to let anyone on stage with him that doesn&#8217;t have the chops to keep up, and again they definitely fit the bill.  I don&#8217;t know where Prince found them (seriously does he have a lab where he creates all these gorgeous and talented women?), but I&#8217;m glad he did.</p>
<p>The bigger surprise, though, was that after Wednesday night&#8217;s crowd saw bandleader Prince, and Thursday got keyboard jamming Prince, Friday was gifted with the presence of guitar virtuoso/rock god Prince.  The band took the stage and Prince stood silently at the front with his guitar strapped on and his head bowed (wearing pants with one black and one white leg, what appeared to be a purple velour jacket (the lighting at the Dakota wasn&#8217;t designed for this kind of show so it was hard to tell for sure), a white puffy shirt open to the chest, and gold chains).  As the crowd whooped and tittered, Prince give a forceful &#8216;shhhh&#8217;, instantly silencing the crowd and drawing a Cheshire grin from the man of the hour.  Silence then fell again for about 20 seconds.  It seemed at first that Prince might be setting the mood, but once the music started it was clear the silence was just the calm before the storm.  The band launched into a raucous five song stretch (&#8220;Endorphinemachine&#8221; &#8211; &#8220;Screwdriver&#8221; &#8211; &#8220;When You Were Mine&#8221; &#8211; &#8220;Guitar&#8221; &#8211; (song that has left my memory)) that didn&#8217;t give anyone a chance to breathe.  Thereafter, the show was a wonderful, noisy blur of cymbal crashes, funky bass lines, and screaming guitar solos from both Prince and Donna.  There were only occasional chances to catch our breath when Prince took to the piano.  In short, to quote a friend of mine, Prince and the band &#8220;rocked our [word omitted in deference to Prince no longer cursing] faces off&#8221;.</p>
<p>Highlights of the set included the funky slow jam &#8220;Beautiful Strange&#8221;, which may well have impregnated several women in the audience, to close the main set, a solo piano version of &#8220;How Come U Don&#8217;t Call Me Anymore&#8221; to open the encore, and the surprise of the night: &#8220;Purple Rain&#8221;.  To be fair, &#8220;Purple Rain was both a highlight and slightly disappointing (if that&#8217;s possible).  It was disappointing both because it was one of the few songs where Prince put his guitar to the side and played the piano, and because the band chilled the song out while only playing the first verse and extended outro.  It was a highlight, though, because it was Prince playing &#8220;Purple Rain&#8221; 25 or so feet away from me, and to be honest it&#8217;s hard to be objective about that.</p>
<p>Another happy surprise was Prince&#8217;s mood.  He was clearly having a great time on the evening, cracking several jokes including asking if anyone in the crowd was related to him before stating that we&#8217;re all related, noting about drummer Hannah, &#8220;spell it backwards and it&#8217;s the same&#8221;, and referring to himself at one point as an &#8220;androgynous pirate&#8221;.</p>
<p>Put all of this together, and it is difficult for me to say I&#8217;ve ever been to a more enjoyable show.  Judging by the smiles on the rest of the audience&#8217;s faces as they left the Dakota in a deaf daze, I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m alone in this belief.  Accordingly, Prince gets an <strong>A+</strong>.</p>
