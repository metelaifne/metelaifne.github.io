		<description><![CDATA[Steve, I thoroughly enjoyed reading your comment.  I&#039;m very glad to hear you appreciate Bob Carpenter&#039;s music - and thanks for mentioning Gene Clark&#039;s &#039;No Other&#039; album.  I have &#039;White Light&#039; but am unfamiliar with &#039;No Other.&#039; I&#039;m streaming it now as I write and already loving it. Yes, it certainly is the perfect &#039;spiritual cousin&#039; to Silent Passage, isn&#039;t it? Thanks so much for the background info. And (saving the best for last) I can&#039;t wait to check out Jackson C. Frank.  This is a new artist for me.  Really looking forward to reading up on him and listening to the album.  It really is amazing how recordings like this sound just as current today as they did 30+ years ago.  Thank you so much for visiting MiG and posting your comment.

Best,
Kez]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you for the great review as well as Randy&#039;s story.  Wow!  I came to know of this amazing album via a post to a Gene Clark forum about &quot;Silent Passage&quot; similarities with Gene&#039;s &quot;No Other&quot; album.  As you may know, &quot;No Other&quot; is another well-produced cosmic spiritual journey recorded at the same time as &quot;Silent Passage&quot; with many of the same musicians.  Even though Gene Clark achieved notoriety as a founding member of the Byrds, he had an extremely checkered career as he battled personal demons and obscurity, occasionally releasing brilliant music until his untimely death in 1991.  While &quot;Silent Passage&quot; and &quot;No Other&quot; are reminiscent of each other in a number of aspects, each album offers up its own unique brilliance.  Call them &quot;spiritual cousins&quot; of one another!

As taken as I was with Bob Carpenter and his story, it inspired me to seek out other obscure folk singers whose names have become lost (or nearly lost) due to circumstance or fate.  Thanks to the internet I found several lists of obscure folk singers with many putting American folk singer Jackson C. Frank at the very top.  This is due to the amazing quality of his music as well as the tragic tale of his life.  Like Carpenter, Frank only released one album in his lifetime, his self-titled LP from 1965 that was produced by Paul Simon when both artists were spending time in England.  Although largely unknown, Frank had a significant impact and influence on the burgeoning English folk-rock scene of the time. This was due to his exceptional songwriting skills which were significantly more advanced than future stars like Sandy Denny, Bert Jansch, John Renbourn, Al Stewart and Roy Harper, who were all on the scene at the same time and who became good friends with Jackson.  Frank also served as a MAJOR influence on a young Nick Drake, who recorded numerous Jackson C. Frank songs in the time before he made his first record.

Sadly, Frank was a tortured individual who was a victim of horrible school fire in his youth in which he was severely burned.  His music has an other worldly haunted sound that cannot be forgotten.  After his time in England, he descended into mental illness and homelessness, occasionally recording but never releasing any more music.  He died in 1999, and subsequently most of his unreleased recordings have come out posthumously).  Jackson C. Frank&#039;s music and story has to be heard and stands as great as Bob Carpenter and Gene Clark.  Here are some links:

		<description><![CDATA[You&#039;re right. There&#039;s also been a more recent tendency in reviews to adopt the term in a second, more recent sense, referring to things at the boundary of classical and ambient - Nils Frahm, Olafur Arnalds, JOhan Johansson and the like. You can view that either as inaccurate usage or reappropriation of a term for a new use. I tend to think the former. Either way I included the tag here simply to reflect that usage and therefore how some people might be searching. Sorry if it misled you. Thanks for stopping by.]]></description>
