				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This has been another excellent year in classical recordings for me. I remain amazed at how much fine music of the past there is for me to discover, not to mention the brand-new delights that are increasingly catching my ear. This process of exploration means that, as usual, my list tends to avoid the standard classical repertoire but nevertheless covers plenty of ground.<span id="more-5279"></span></p>

<strong> David Lang: The Difficulty of Crossing a Field</strong><br />
<em> Beverly O&#8217;Regan Thiele; Jay O. Sanders; Harlem String Quartet; Douglas Kinney Frost</em><br />
<em> [Cantaloupe]</em></p>
<p>David Lang&#8217;s signature dark beauties are on full display in this 2002 opera. Ambrose Bierce&#8217;s short-short story is essentially a piece of reportage describing the unexplained disappearance of an Alabama plantation owner as he walked across a pasture; Mac Wellman&#8217;s libretto ingeniously expands on the tale, still providing no answers but adding great depth and humanity.</p>

<strong> Field Recordings</strong><br />
<em>Bang On A Can All-Stars</em><br />
<em> [Cantaloupe]</em></p>
<p>Twelve new pieces (plus an extract from Steve Reich&#8217;s <em>The Cave</em>) in which the composer makes use of a piece of previously recorded material: from John Cage speaking (Florent Ghys) to Chicago street musicians (Anna Clyne) to blades being sharpened (David Lang). Despite the varied nature of the fare on offer, it all comes together wonderfully to make a proper album.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<strong> Render</strong><br />
<em>Roomful of Teeth</em><br />
<em> [New Amsterdam]</em></p>
<p>Back in the height of the avant-garde, people like Berio, Ligeti and Stockhausen were writing weird pieces that explored the possibilities of what could be done with the human voice. If, like me, you admired the cleverness and occasional wit of it all but wished they could, you know, write a good tune, then this compelling new music in thrilling performances is just what you need.</p>

<strong> Nikolai Peyko: Piano music, volume 2</strong><br />
<em>Dmitry Korostelyov</em><br />
<em> [Toccata]</em></p>
<p>Nikolay Peyko (1916-1995) was an important figure in Russian musical life, though I&#8217;d not heard of him before this album. The music here ranges from 1942 to 1992 and is what you might expect (indeed, hope for) from someone who was once Shostakovich&#8217;s teaching assistant. Unfortunately little of Peyko&#8217;s music is available in recordings, but he might deserve a Weinberg-style revival.</p>

<strong> Lauren Karpman: Ask Your Mama</strong><br />
<em>various; San Francisco Ballet Orchestra/George Manahan</em><br />
<em> [Avie]</em></p>
<p>When Langston Hughes published his epic <em>Ask Your Mama: 12 Moods for Jazz</em> in 1961, he included in the margins instructions for musical accompaniment. In her equally epic setting that fuses jazz, hip-hop and classical with a bit of sound collage thrown in, Lauren Karpman follows his lead – though sometimes more as guideline than as gospel – to inspired effect.</p>

<strong> If the Owl Calls Again</strong><br />
<em>Christianne Stotijn</em><br />
<em> [Warner]</em></p>
<p>One of my favourite mezzos here presents a recital inspired by her fascination with owls as a source of wisdom and what she calls “philosophical recognition of nature”. It&#8217;s a diverse set of music – from Mussorgsky through Bridge and Ravel to the present-day, with texts in seven languages – but Stotijn&#8217;s committed performances bind it all into a coherent whole.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<strong> JS Bach: Goldberg Variations (arr Sitkovetsky)</strong><br />
<em>Britten Sinfonia/Thomas Gould</em><br />
<em> [Harmonia Mundi]</em></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve remarked before that Bach&#8217;s music lends itself to arrangement for pretty much any instrument, and here we are again&#8230; Dmitri Sitkovetsky created a string trio version in 1985, then expanded it for string orchestra as heard here. The timbre has a lovely warm glow – none of the clotted excesses of the “big band” Bach of yore.</p>

<strong> Haydn &amp; Mozart: Concertos</strong><br />
<em>Arcangelo/Jonathan Cohen</em><br />
<em> [Hyperion]</em></p>
<p>Speaking of “big band” music, when this release came out I realised that my only recordings of Mozart&#8217;s oboe and bassoon concertos were the 40-year-old ones from Karl Böhm and the Vienna Philharmonic. We live in a different world now! Arcangelo has become a real go-to group for 18th-century music – this year&#8217;s recording of Mozart violin concertos with Vilde Frang is also a keeper.</p>

<strong> Yes!</strong><br />
<em>Julie Fuchs</em><br />
<em> [Deutsche Grammophon]</em></p>
<p>As might be anticipated from its affirmative title, this French soprano&#8217;s collection of arias and songs from the early 20th century is a mostly cheerful affair. There are some old favourites – Lehár&#8217;s <em>Vilja-Lied</em>, Weill&#8217;s <em>Morität von Mackie Messer</em>, and Youmans&#8217;s <em>Tea for two</em> (all <em>en Français</em>) – but plenty of charming discoveries from the likes of Messager, Hahn, and Honegger.</p>

<strong> Lois V Vierk: Words Fail Me</strong><br />
<em>various</em><br />
<em> [New World]</em></p>
<p>A notable figure in the downtown New York scene of the 80s and 90s, Vierk hasn&#8217;t composed much since then because of a long-term illness. Her music&#8217;s minimalist, but greatly influenced by the courtly <em>gagaku</em> music of Japan. Three of the four pieces here are from 1991-6; the title work from 2005 is a response to 9/11, 7 minutes of melancholy followed by 12 of a relentlessly driving climax.</p>

<strong> Julia Wolfe: Anthracite Fields</strong><br />
<em>Trinity Wall Street Choir; Bang On A Can All-Stars</em><br />
<em> [Cantaloupe]</em></p>
<p>The Pulitzer Prize for Music has been on a roll lately, the last three winners being Caroline Shaw, John Luther Adams, and now – hurrah! &#8211; Julia Wolfe. <em>Anthracite Fields</em> is an oratorio paying tribute to the coal miners of Pennsylvania and their families; in its mix of folk materials, Glass-like minimalism and much else besides, it builds on Wolfe&#8217;s achievements in <em>Steel Hammer</em>.</p>

<strong> Philip Glass: Complete Etudes</strong><br />
<em>Nicolas Horvath</em><br />
<em> [Grand Piano]</em></p>
<p>2015 was the year Philip Glass became one of my favourite composers again. I first fell in love with his late-70s/early-80s works (such as the “trilogy operas”) but wasn&#8217;t so impressed with his subsequent work. More recently, though, he seems to have found new focus (or perhaps it&#8217;s just me), and the two sets of etudes from 1995 and 2012 add a dash of romanticism to his familiar style.</p>

<strong> Postcard from Heaven</strong><br />
<em>Susan Allen</em><br />
<em> [New World]</em></p>
<p>An album of music mostly for solo harp should not under normal circumstances make my end-of-year list. But bookended by two John Cage pieces – <em>In a Landscape</em> and the title work – Susan Allen&#8217;s recital has little hint of the drawing-room about it. Gloria Coates&#8217;s Goethe-inspired <em>Perchance to Dream</em> for harp and vibraphone is the haunting highlight.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<strong> Time Present and Time Past</strong><br />
<em>Mahan Esfahani; Concerto Köln</em><br />
<em> [Deutsche Grammophon]</em></p>
<p>Harpsichordist-of-the-moment Mahan Esfahani&#8217;s major-label debut doesn&#8217;t play it safe. Yes, we&#8217;ve got works from Geminiani, a Scarlatti, and a couple of Bachs, but there&#8217;s also Gorécki&#8217;s 1980 harpsichord concerto and – what? &#8211; an arrangement of Steve Reich&#8217;s <em>Piano Phase</em>. An ingenious addition that works so well it elevates the rest of the album onto this list.</p>

<strong> Concert Celeste</strong><br />
<em>Ensemble Obsidienne/Emmanuel Bonnardot</em><br />
<em> [Eloquentia]</em></p>
<p>Ensemble Obsidienne have been artists in residence at Sens cathedral, France, for several years, and they take the 850th anniversary of the cathedral&#8217;s construction as the inspiration for this “musical adventure” . The program&#8217;s centered around four specific feasts of the church year, but it covers enough ground, geographically and chronologically, to function as a handy introduction to medieval music generally.</p>

<strong> Olivier Messiaen: L&#8217;Amour et la Foi</strong><br />
<em>Danish National Vocal Ensemble &amp; Chamber Choir/Marcus Creed</em><br />
<em> [OUR]</em></p>
<p>I wouldn&#8217;t usually expect Messiaen to show up on one of these lists either, because I&#8217;ve never really warmed to his particular brand of mystic modernism. But sometimes you take a chance and it works out splendidly, and such is this case here. Perhaps it&#8217;s that the three works here are early ones; anyway, I was hooked by the varied colours and occasional weirdnesses on display.</p>

<strong> The Tempest</strong><br />
<em>La Tempête/Simon-Pierre Bestion</em><br />
<em> [Alpha]</em><br />
The songs in Shakespeare&#8217;s “The Tempest” have been set many times, and here the appropriately named La Tempête places Frank Martin&#8217;s a cappella <em>Songs of Ariel</em> in among the incidental music composed by Matthew Locke and others for a 1674 production of the play, along with some other unconnected old and new works. The contrasting styles work surprisingly well together.</p>

<strong> John Adams: Absolute Jest; Grand Pianola Music</strong><br />
<em>St. Lawrence String Quartet; San Francisco Symphony/Michael Tilson Thomas</em><br />
<em> [SFS Media]</em></p>
<p>John Adams called the creation of <em>Absolute Jest</em>, for the odd combination of string quartet and orchestra, a “lesson in counterpoint, in thematic transformation and formal design”, which makes it sound a lot less fun that what it is: a joyful play on various Beethoven scherzos. It&#8217;s a worthy companion to the older <em>Grand Pianola Music</em>, which shocked modernists with its use of a big tune in the finale.</p>

<strong> JS Bach: Harpsichord concertos</strong><br />
<em>Andreas Staier; Freiburger Barockorchester</em><br />
<em> [Harmonia Mundi]</em></p>
<p>Bach, Staier, Freiburg&#8230; pretty much a no-brainer really. The orchestra has a lovely rich texture when called for, and Staier&#8217;s harpsichord blends well. I&#8217;m not one to ever talk about benchmark performances, but there&#8217;s no reason why these vivacious ones can&#8217;t be considered as such.</p>

<strong> Vaughan Williams, MacMillan: Oboe concertos</strong><br />
<em>Nicholas Daniel; Britten Sinfonia/James MacMillan</em><br />
<em> [Harmonia Mundi]</em></p>
<p>A welcome outing for Vaughan Williams&#8217;s gorgeous wartime concerto, accompanied by a new one from James MacMillan that should easily enter the repertoire. Nicholas Daniel, for whom the work was written, sparkles in the lively outer movements and consoles in the powerful lamenting middle movement. As a substantial filler we get Britten&#8217;s late folk suite <em>A Time There Was</em>.</p>

<strong> Michael Gordon: Dystopia; Rewriting Beethoven&#8217;s Seventh Symphony</strong><br />
<em>Los Angeles Philharmonic/David Robertson; Bamberg Symphony/Jonathan Nott</em><br />
<em> [Cantaloupe]</em></p>
<p>I guess <em>Dystopia</em> in all its brash chaos is intended as the main attraction here – and it&#8217;s quite a workout for the orchestra – but its shorter companion is the one that most caught my ear. <em>Rewriting Beethoven&#8217;s Seventh Symphony</em> does exactly that: brief segments of each movement of that iconic work are subjected to various shenanigans to create something truly spellbinding.</p>

<strong> Bryce Dessner: Music for Wood and Strings</strong><br />
<em>So Percussion</em><br />
<em> [Brassland]</em></p>
<p>When I heard this work for specially built dulcimer-like instruments in concert back in March, I said “It’s a bitty sort of piece but falls easy on the ear.” I suspected it would grow on me with further listens, and the recording that soon followed has confirmed its pleasures. Without the benefit of seeing the performers, it&#8217;s even harder to believe that they&#8217;re percussionists.</p>

<strong> Arvo Pärt: Tintinnabuli</strong><br />
<em>Tallis Scholars/Peter Phillips</em><br />
<em> [Gimell]</em></p>
<p>It&#8217;s rare that the Tallis Scholars go near post-Renaissance music, but Pärt and his use of diatonic melody makes an obvious fit. The choir also stick to their usual style, with two voices to a part, which reinforces the connection. The results are as fine as you might want, even if you bought the album thinking it had something to do with a certain boy reporter and his dog.</p>

<strong> Philip Glass: Partita for solo violin</strong><br />
<em>Tim Fain</em><br />
<em> [Orange Mountain Music]</em></p>
<p>If the title alone sounds like a summoning of the ghost of Bach, wait till you hear the music. But my first encounter with Glass – the “Opening” of <em>Glassworks</em> – made me think of Bach, so all these years later I find I&#8217;m not so surprised. A version of “Knee 2” from <em>Einstein on the Beach</em> shows how Glass&#8217;s music both has and hasn&#8217;t changed over the intervening three decades.</p>

<strong> Johan Wagenaar: Sinfonietta &amp; symphonic poems</strong><br />
<em>Nordwestdeutsche Philharmonie/Antony Hermus</em><br />
<em> [CPO]</em></p>
<p>The Dutch composer&#8217;s Sinfonietta was composed in 1917 when he was in his mid-fifties, and it sounds to me for all the world like a very light-hearted Mahler. I know Wagneaar at some point in his life conducted Mahler&#8217;s music, but I have no idea if this piece is a deliberate homage. Either way, it&#8217;s a wonderful surprise. The other works provide more Straussian pleasures.</p>

<p>This is, alas, the final album from the fantastic four. It&#8217;s the third in their series of recordings of American folk music, and here their distinctive vocal blend is accompanied/enhanced by Bruce Molsky&#8217;s fiddle, banjo, guitar and voice. As the title indicates, it&#8217;s Civil War-era music, including several still-popular tunes.</p>

<strong> Johann Hermann Schein: Musica Boscareccia</strong><br />
<em>United Continuo Ensemble/Thor-Harald Johnsen</em><br />
<em> [Pan]</em></p>
<p>In my ongoing explorations, I&#8217;ve yet to get a firm handle on the music of the 17th century (with some obvious exceptions like Monteverdi and Purcell). Schein&#8217;s 1621 collection of secular songs for 1-3 voices, which loosely translates as “Forest Music”, helps fill a gap; he was one of the first German composers to make use of the new Italian style of the early Baroque, and these performances certainly feel fresh.</p>

<strong> Armarium</strong><br />
<em>Amarcord</em><br />
<em> [Raumklang]</em></p>
<p>The vocal sextet Amarcord was founded by former members of the St. Thomas Boys Choir in Leipzig, and this release celebrates the rich heritage of musical manuscripts housed at St. Thomas&#8217;s, an armarium being a book cabinet. Bach was of course the most famous cantor there, but the music here precedes his tenure by a century and more.</p>

<strong> Félicien David: Le Désert</strong><br />
<em>Accentus; Orchestre de Chambre de Paris/Laurence Equilbey</em><br />
<em> [Naive]</em></p>
<p><em>Le Désert</em> was a big success when it first appeared in 1844, counting Berlioz among its fans, but it&#8217;s been mostly forgotten for some time. This “ode-symphonie” depicting a caravan&#8217;s journey helped usher in a fad for Orientalism, though in fairness to David his inspiration came from an actual trip to the Middle East. Maybe not a major (re)discovery, but most entertaining nonetheless.</p>

<strong> Douglas Lilburn: Chamber music for strings</strong><br />

Vaughan Williams was his composition tutor when he studied in London, and I think it&#8217;s fair to say that if you enjoy VW you&#8217;ll probably like these pieces from the 1940s and 50s. As an introduction to an unknown composer, this is superb.</p>

Bang on a Can came to Dublin, and the weather improved too.<span id="more-4924"></span></p>

<p class="western">“What?&#8230; Wow” was, in festival curator David Lang&#8217;s program note, “made by putting together some of the children and grandchildren and maybe by now even great-grandchildren of composers who happen to live down the street from me, and who changed the world.” So he brought along his Bang on a Can friends Julia Wolfe and Michael Gordon, and the Bang on a Can All-Stars, and So Percussion, and for good measure WNYC Radio&#8217;s John Schaefer, and they met up with a whole bunch of Irish musicians in Dublin&#8217;s National Concert Hall, and the result was&#8230; well, here&#8217;s David Lang again, in an <a href="http://www.irishtimes.com/culture/music/david-lang-minimalism-existed-for-about-a-minute-1.2120463">interview</a> with the <i>Irish Times</i> last week: “I’m going to feel disappointed if somebody comes to this concert and likes everything”.</p>
<p>Hmm. There were 19 pieces of music performed over the two days; I heard all but one, and I really hate to disappoint Mr. Lang but&#8230; Maybe if I&#8217;d been able to get to the first performance, Tom Johnson&#8217;s minimalist classic <i>Nine Bells</i> done by percussionist Olaf Pyras, I might not have liked it, but what are the chances?</p>
<div id="attachment_4930" style="width: 250px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/what-wow-david-langs-festival-of-music-in-dublin/wolfe-e1425840157778.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4930" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/what-wow-david-langs-festival-of-music-in-dublin/wolfe-e1425840157778-292x300.jpg" alt="Julia Wolfe" width="240" height="247" srcset="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/what-wow-david-langs-festival-of-music-in-dublin/wolfe-e1425840157778-292x300.jpg 292w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/what-wow-david-langs-festival-of-music-in-dublin/wolfe-e1425840157778-996x1024.jpg 996w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/what-wow-david-langs-festival-of-music-in-dublin/wolfe-e1425840157778.jpg 1225w" sizes="(max-width: 240px) 100vw, 240px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Times,'Times New Roman',serif;">Julia Wolfe</span></span></p></div>
<p class="western">So the festival for me kicked off with my initial reason for going, Julia Wolfe&#8217;s incredible “art-ballad” <i>Steel Hammer,</i>performed, as on the album, by Trio Medieval and the Bang on a Can All-Stars. Seeing it live made me realise I&#8217;d not given much thought to how some of the sounds on the album were produced: that sound evoking a piston engine coming to life? That&#8217;s the band rubbing sheets of sandpaper together. That foot-tapping noise throughout the whole “Characteristics” section? That&#8217;s guitarist Mark Stewart&#8217;s <i>actual feet.</i> And so forth. It was a magnificent performance of a brilliant piece, by superb musicians&#8230; Lord, Lord. I was pleased to be able to thank Julia Wolfe in person. All this went on at the hall&#8217;s Engineering Library (the building was once owned by a university), which I&#8217;d never been in before and which I assumed would be an elegant Victorian room, its walls still lined with ceiling-height bookshelves, a few tall windows allowing the setting sun to cast a warm glow&#8230; well, it did have walls, I&#8217;ll grant you that. The NCH really needs to construct better performance spaces. Or at least get some lads in with a few tins of paint.</p>
<p class="western">Anyway. The <i>other</i> main reason I was there was the European premiere of John Luther Adams&#8217;s big and beautiful orchestral piece <i>Become Ocean,</i> a work that seems to have a better chance than most of making its way into the repertoire. In the main auditorium, the RTÉ National Symphony Orchestra was led by young (23!) English conductor Jamie Phillips, who showed a fine command of proceedings. It&#8217;s a paradoxical piece in a way, because it&#8217;s very carefully structured and symmetrical, yet it relies for its effect on seeming random, like the waves of the ocean. If you had a stopwatch you could easily track the various large and small climaxes, but it&#8217;s so much better to sit back and let these gorgeous swells wash over you. I could have listened all night.</p>
<p class="western">In the interest of brevity, let&#8217;s quickly mention the three other works in that concert: David Lang&#8217;s <i>man made</i> (with So Percussion; satisfying)<i>,</i> Irene Buckley&#8217;s <i>Stórr</i> (inspired by Hebridean church singing; lovely), and Anna Clyne&#8217;s <i>&lt;&lt;Rewind&lt;&lt;</i> (evoking a videotape skipping backwards; amusing).</p>
<div id="attachment_4927" style="width: 250px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/what-wow-david-langs-festival-of-music-in-dublin/gordon-e1425840232233.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4927" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/what-wow-david-langs-festival-of-music-in-dublin/gordon-e1425840232233-282x300.jpg" alt="Michael Gordon" width="240" height="255" srcset="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/what-wow-david-langs-festival-of-music-in-dublin/gordon-e1425840232233-282x300.jpg 282w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/what-wow-david-langs-festival-of-music-in-dublin/gordon-e1425840232233-962x1024.jpg 962w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/what-wow-david-langs-festival-of-music-in-dublin/gordon-e1425840232233.jpg 1240w" sizes="(max-width: 240px) 100vw, 240px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Times,'Times New Roman',serif;">Michael Gordon</span></span></p></div>
<p class="western">But I must talk properly about Michael Gordon&#8217;s new piece, which was so new that it was listed on the festival program as “new work” and we were only told its title when the composer spoke just before the Dublin Guitar Quartet gave its premiere. <i>Amplified</i> is what it is, by name and nature. If you&#8217;ve heard last year&#8217;s release of Gordon&#8217;s bassoon piece <i>Rushes</i> then let me simply describe the general feel of it as “like <i>Rushes</i> but with four amplified guitars”. I admit he had to win me over on this one. It was 10.30, the close of a busy day, there was still an hour-long midnight bus journey ahead, and after about a minute of rather harsh-sounding pulses of loud reverb, each player picking out single notes, I feared an hour of noisy tedium. But I closed my eyes and something wonderful happened as I realised that those pulses were travelling from left to right (I was on the right-hand side of the audience) in a continuous wash; that harshness was now something more soothing, though still not an easy ride. It was hypnotic, and I lost track of time; when abruptly the pulses changed &#8211; the guitarists were now in synch and the sound was tumbling forward from them rather than across the performance area &#8211; I reckoned maybe 20 minutes had passed but in hindsight it was probably more like 45. After a while more the reverb began to fall away, and soon we were down to bare picked notes and then&#8230; nothing. For me, <i>Amplified</i> was a valuable lesson in how the impact of a minimalist work can often come from stepping back and appreciating the whole work, rather than (as we usually do with classical) listening from one moment to the next. And also a vivid demonstration of how sometimes it&#8217;s not the actual notes but the sound around the notes that becomes interesting.</p>
<p class="western">And that was just the first day.</p>
<p class="western">Day two began with a Bang on a Can Brunch, which is like a regular brunch but with the founders of a ground-breaking contemporary music organisation sitting in the corner being interviewed. The burger was delicious; the conversation was entertaining. John Schaeffer took the trio through the history of Bang on a Can, and there was time for one question from the audience (I&#8217;m paraphrasing: “Michael Gordon, do you agree with me that <i>Amplified</i> is just a butt-ugly stepchild of Steve Reich&#8217;s <i>Music for 18 Musicians</i>?”). Favourite anecdote: John Cage came to the first Bang on a Can show but left before they played the piece of his they&#8217;d programmed, because “it was past his bedtime”.</p>
<p class="western">So day two was a Bang on a Can Marathon, but David Lang told us we were getting off lightly: just four hours in the afternoon and two that night. Ten works were performed in the first session, the idea being that the audience could come and go as it pleased; I imagine that most of us heard everything, though. Why would you not? So Percussion opened the Marathon with <i>Music for Wood &amp; Strings</i> by Bryce Dessner, who&#8217;s becoming well-enough established as a composer that he soon won&#8217;t need to have “of The National” after his name all the time. The work uses four specially designed instruments resembling hammered dulcimers, and the ultimate sonic effect is that the percussionists sound a lot more like guitarists than you might reasonably expect. It&#8217;s a bitty sort of piece but falls easy on the ear. Chamber Choir Ireland gave us a short and lovely piece for sopranos and altos by the Dane Pelle Gudmundsen-Holmgreen, whose “new simplicity” style fitted well with the festival vibe. The RTÉ ConTempo Quartet (RTÉ is the state broadcaster) were next, with Garrett Sholdice&#8217;s <i>Das Blaue Licht, </i>a nice piece whose first part was entirely pizzicato; the quartet later played George Crumb&#8217;s grotesque/beautiful <i>Black Angels</i> from 1970 &#8211; another work that really benefits from <i>seeing</i> the performance. Bang on a Can All-Stars brought us two strong pieces: Kate Moore&#8217;s <i>Ridgeway</i>, a reflection on home and memory that sounded to me like a ghost parade, and Donnacha Dennehy&#8217;s characteristically punchy <i>Streetwalker.</i></p>

<p class="western">What else? The Crash Ensemble, of course. We heard Seán Clancy&#8217;s <i>14 minutes of music on the subject of greeting cards</i> (a melancholic birth-to-death journey, for piano, violin and flute) and Linda Buckley&#8217;s brand-new <i>Torann</i> (Irish for “noise”, inspired by the sea, an Icelandic volcano, and milking machines), but before those there was Andrew Hamilton&#8217;s <i>Music for people who like art</i>, described a few years ago by an Irish critic as “20 minutes of my life that I will never get back” and by me right now as 20 minutes of something like advertising jingles chopped up and repeated in a hard-driven and unpredictable way for a hilariously unconscionable amount of time, topped with a female voice quoting Ad Reinhardt&#8217;s “Art is Art” statement while also occasionaly screeching, choking and throwing up, that eventually and for no apparent reason transmogrifies into something like a horribly distorted half-remembered version of the Shangri-Las&#8217; “Leader of the Pack”. I have no idea what the composer intended, but I laughed all the way through.</p>
<p class="western">Oh, <i>and</i> Crash&#8217;s pianist Andrew Zolinsky played Meredith Monk&#8217;s <i>St. Petersburg Waltz.</i></p>
<div id="attachment_4928" style="width: 570px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/what-wow-david-langs-festival-of-music-in-dublin/irish-composers.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4928" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/what-wow-david-langs-festival-of-music-in-dublin/irish-composers-1024x768.jpg" alt="Q&amp;A with Irish composers.

<p class="western">Which leaves us with the final concert. Okay, I admit that with Brian Eno&#8217;s <i>Music for Airports</i> (in its Bang on a Can arrangement, of course) I came the closest to not liking, but it wasn&#8217;t the music itself that was the issue &#8211; it&#8217;s just that seeing as the whole point of the music is that it&#8217;s <i>background</i>, it felt at times too incongruous to be sitting in a packed concert hall listening carefully as if this were Brahms. But the All-Stars were great, the first part is a gorgeous thing, and the last featured some wonderful clarinetting from Ken Thomson; Evan Ziporyn&#8217;s contribution to the arrangement takes the music out of the “merely” ambient and turns it into a bona fide concert piece.</p>
<p class="western">And, to cap it all, Steve Reich&#8217;s <i>Music for 18 Musicians.</i> You don&#8217;t need me to tell you the significance of this work, or what it sounds like. All I want to say about the performance is this: imagine Steve Reich&#8217;s <i>Music for 18 Musicians </i>performed by So Percussion and various members of the Bang on a Can All-Stars, Chamber Choir Ireland, and the Crash Ensemble<i>.</i> <i>That&#8217;s</i> how good it was. A triumphant end to a wonderful two days of music-making.</p>

The usual caveats apply regarding how representative of the year&#8217;s releases this is, with the added proviso that I tend to avoid new recordings of repertoire that&#8217;s already in my collection, which brings the selection somewhat away from the mainstream. That said, I&#8217;ve covered a lot of ground and the 15 albums collectively serve to demonstrate just how broad the term “classical music” is—and how <em>new</em> centuries-old music can sound.</p>
<p class="western"><b>#1.</b></p>
<p class="western"><b>Anna Prohaska. Behind the Lines [DG]</b></p>
<p class="western">The Austrian soprano marks the centenary of the First World War, with a selection of songs spanning several centuries and countries. From the opening folk song segueing into a piece from Beethoven&#8217;s “Egmont” music, through such varied composers as Roger Quilter and Wolfgang Rihm, to the final pair of Whitman settings by Kurt Weill, Prohaska is always at home. A superb, moving recital.<span id="more-4796"></span></p>

<p class="western"><b>Brodsky Quartet. New World Quartets [Chandos]</b></p>
<p class="western">A joyful account of Dvořák&#8217;s “American” quartet (composed in Iowa) kicks off a collection of otherwise “genuine” American works, including a fine pair from Copland that I&#8217;d never heard before. The Brodskys give a superb rendition of Barber&#8217;s quartet, including a blazing Adagio (yes, <i>the</i> Adagio). Gershwin, Brubeck, and Copland&#8217;s Hoe-Down round off the show.</p>
<p class="western"><b><a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/top-15-old-classical-of-2014-stephen-j-nereffid/roth.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4810" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/top-15-old-classical-of-2014-stephen-j-nereffid/roth.jpg" alt="roth" width="150" height="137" /></a>#3.</b></p>
<p class="western"><b>Linus Roth. Britten &amp; Weinberg: Violin concertos [Challenge]</b></p>
<p class="western">The first movement of Weinberg&#8217;s 1959 concerto turned out to be my most-played track of the year. I continue to resist the temptation to go on a massive binge of discovering Weinberg&#8217;s music; my restraint is rewarded by discoveries such as this. I agree with Roth: this concerto fully deserves a place in the repertoire. Oh yes, and the Britten is splendid too!</p>

<p class="western"><b>Daniel Hope. Escape to Paradise [DG]</b></p>
<p class="western">Subtitled “The Hollywood Album”, this is another cleverly put-together themed album from Hope (see last year&#8217;s “Spheres”). The basic concept is that this is music from composers who fled Europe in the thirties and ended up in Hollywood, though even the booklet notes admit the notion must be hugely stretched to accommodate some of the selections. No matter: beauty and charm abound.</p>

<p class="western"><b>Teodor Currentzis. Rameau: The Sound of Light [Sony]</b></p>
<p class="western">2014 marked the 250th anniversary of Jean-Philippe Rameau&#8217;s death, though I didn&#8217;t see much increased activity in the recording world. A pity. This selection of (mostly) instrumental music performed by Currentzis and MusicAeterna is full of life (and light) and should win new fans for Rameau and French baroque music generally.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="western"><b>Roman Mints. Dance of Shadows [Quartz]</b></p>
<p class="western">A solo album from this Russian violinist who can always be relied on to produce an intriguing program. Studio trickery plays with perspective in Ysaÿe&#8217;s second sonata, and Mints accompanies himself on hurdy-gurdy in Dobrinka Tabakova&#8217;s “Spinning a Yarn”. His pleasingly raw tone is ideal for the pieces by Piazzolla (unexpectedly desolate), Schnittke (thrilling), and Silvestrov (haunting).</p>
<p class="western"><b><a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/top-15-old-classical-of-2014-stephen-j-nereffid/dinnerstein.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4800" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/top-15-old-classical-of-2014-stephen-j-nereffid/dinnerstein.jpg" alt="dinnerstein" width="150" height="149" srcset="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/top-15-old-classical-of-2014-stephen-j-nereffid/dinnerstein.jpg 200w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/top-15-old-classical-of-2014-stephen-j-nereffid/dinnerstein-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a>#7.</b></p>
<p class="western"><b>Simone Dinnerstein. Bach: Inventions and Sinfonias [Sony]</b></p>
<p class="western">Being honest, I have to say that pretty much <i>any</i> performance of Bach piano music stands a reasonable chance of making it onto a best-of-the-year list; there&#8217;s something so “just right” about it. Angela Hewitt&#8217;s “Art of Fugue” on Hyperion was a contender too, but the charm of these smaller pieces won it for Dinnerstein.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="western"><b><a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/top-15-old-classical-of-2014-stephen-j-nereffid/prometheus.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4808" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/top-15-old-classical-of-2014-stephen-j-nereffid/prometheus.jpg" alt="prometheus" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/top-15-old-classical-of-2014-stephen-j-nereffid/prometheus.jpg 200w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/top-15-old-classical-of-2014-stephen-j-nereffid/prometheus-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a>#8.</b></p>
<p class="western"><b>George Petrou/Armonia Atenea. Beethoven: Prometheus [Decca]</b></p>
<p class="western">Aside from the overture, the rest of Beethoven&#8217;s 1801 ballet “The Creatures of Prometheus” was unknown territory for me; what a delight to hear a “new” work from an old friend. It&#8217;s vibrantly played on period instruments by this Greek orchestra. Highlights include an oh-so-Beethoven Pastorale and the finale, where the glorious “Eroica” theme makes its appearance.</p>
<p class="western"><b><a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/top-15-old-classical-of-2014-stephen-j-nereffid/inspired.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4803" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/top-15-old-classical-of-2014-stephen-j-nereffid/inspired.jpg" alt="inspired" width="150" height="149" srcset="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/top-15-old-classical-of-2014-stephen-j-nereffid/inspired.jpg 200w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/top-15-old-classical-of-2014-stephen-j-nereffid/inspired-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a>#9.</b></p>
<p class="western"><b>Stefan Temmingh &amp; Dorothee Mields. Inspired by Song [DHM]</b></p>
<p class="western">Temmingh&#8217;s recorder alternates with Mields&#8217;s soprano in a collection of popular (then and/or now) “baroque tunes and English songs”. It&#8217;s really Temmingh&#8217;s project, and his full-bodied playing sounds wonderful (as do the other musicians), but Mields steals the show for me, with a voice and singing personality that reminds me of Emma Kirkby.</p>
<p class="western"><b><a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/top-15-old-classical-of-2014-stephen-j-nereffid/novak.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4806" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/top-15-old-classical-of-2014-stephen-j-nereffid/novak.jpg" alt="novak" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/top-15-old-classical-of-2014-stephen-j-nereffid/novak.jpg 200w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/top-15-old-classical-of-2014-stephen-j-nereffid/novak-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a>#10.</b></p>
<p class="western"><b>Martinů Voices. Novak: Testamentum [Supraphon]</b></p>
<p class="western">Four works for small vocal ensemble by Czech composer Jan Novák, written between 1966 and 1974; for some reason I&#8217;d got him mixed up with his late-Romantic compatriot <span lang="en">Vítězslav, so it was a pleasant surprise to be set right. All four pieces are in Latin, which usually means church music, but in fact only one is religious in nature—the delightful Christmas work “Invitatio pastorum”.</span></p>
<p class="western"><b><a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/top-15-old-classical-of-2014-stephen-j-nereffid/bruggen.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4799" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/top-15-old-classical-of-2014-stephen-j-nereffid/bruggen.jpg" alt="bruggen" width="150" height="134" /></a>#11.</b></p>
<p class="western"><b>Frans Brüggen. Mozart: Symphonies nos.39-41 [Glossa]</b></p>
<p class="western">Brüggen, one of the greats of the early-music movement, died in August, and this recording with the Orchestra of the 18th Century (which he co-founded over thirty years ago) makes a fine memorial. This is big, grand Mozart, performed live in vivid sound. The slow movement of the “Jupiter” symphony is a thing of extraordinary beauty.</p>
<p class="western"><b><a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/top-15-old-classical-of-2014-stephen-j-nereffid/hildegard.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4801" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/top-15-old-classical-of-2014-stephen-j-nereffid/hildegard.jpg" alt="hildegard" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/top-15-old-classical-of-2014-stephen-j-nereffid/hildegard.jpg 200w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/top-15-old-classical-of-2014-stephen-j-nereffid/hildegard-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a>#12.</b></p>
<p class="western"><b>Arianna Savall &amp; Petter Udland Johansen. Hildegard: Vox Cosmica [Carpe Diem]</b></p>
<p class="western">Of course it doesn&#8217;t need saying that she&#8217;s an artist in her own right, but my goodness Arianna Savall can sound very like her mother, Montserrat Figueras. This can only be high praise, obviously, and that marvelous combination of earthy and ethereal is perfect for Hildegard&#8217;s music. Variety is provided by Johansen&#8217;s tenor in a lament by Peter Abelard, along with some very apt, newly created, instrumental “meditations”.</p>
<p class="western"><b><a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/top-15-old-classical-of-2014-stephen-j-nereffid/madness.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4804" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/top-15-old-classical-of-2014-stephen-j-nereffid/madness.jpg" alt="madness" width="150" height="134" /></a>#13.</b></p>
<p class="western"><b>Calmus Ensemble. Madrigals of Madness [Carus]</b></p>
<p class="western">This is the first in an intriguing-sounding series of madrigals devoted to specific emotions. Here we get vividly theatrical performances of pieces addressing the madness of love (not surprisingly, Monteverdi and Gesualdo), war (some highly animated spectaculars by Josquin, Janequin, and Flecha), and loneliness (the melancholic Englishmen Gibbons and Tomkins).</p>
<p class="western"><b><a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/top-15-old-classical-of-2014-stephen-j-nereffid/wood-works.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4811" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/top-15-old-classical-of-2014-stephen-j-nereffid/wood-works.jpg" alt="wood works" width="150" height="134" /></a>#14.</b></p>
<p class="western"><b>Danish String Quartet. Wood Works [Dacapo]</b></p>
<p class="western">There was plenty of folk-inspired music on my new-music list, so here&#8217;s some more. The Danish String Quartet offer their take on some of their favourite tunes from Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and the Faroe Islands; there&#8217;s even a few new compositions. Successfully combining two musical worlds, this is honest, affectionate music-making.</p>
<p class="western"><b><a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/top-15-old-classical-of-2014-stephen-j-nereffid/amorosi.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4797" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/top-15-old-classical-of-2014-stephen-j-nereffid/amorosi.jpg" alt="amorosi" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/top-15-old-classical-of-2014-stephen-j-nereffid/amorosi.jpg 200w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/top-15-old-classical-of-2014-stephen-j-nereffid/amorosi-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a>#15.</b></p>
<p class="western"><b>Cinquecento. Amorosi Pensieri [Hyperion]</b></p>
<p class="western">The six-man group Cinquecento has been performing a great service by resurrecting unknown music from the 1500s as the ensemble&#8217;s name implies). Here they present secular songs in Italian, French and German by four composers at the Hapsburg court: de Monte, Guyot, Vaet and Regnart. Aside from the historical interest, though, these performances are wonderfully pure and fresh.</p>

I&#8217;m defining “new” music simply as music written by people who are still alive, though the bulk of what appears here is from the present century. If you know nothing about contemporary classical, let me assure you that my list is utterly unrepresentative of the overall state of the art. So, with that in mind&#8230;</p>
<p class="western"><strong>#1. </strong></p>
<p class="western"><strong>John Allemeier. Deep Water: The Murder Ballads [Albany]</strong></p>
<p class="western">Ellen Smith, shot through the heart; Frankie Silver, who killed her abusive husband with his own gun and then dismembered him; and Omie Wise, seduced and drowned by a wealthy young man. Three folk songs from North Carolina inspired John Allemeier and choreographer E.E. Balcos to create a darkly lyrical trio of chamber works that together make a single piece of dance theatre. This is vivid music that doesn&#8217;t need to be seen to be believed.</p>
<p class="western"><span id="more-4754"></span></p>
<p class="western"><a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/best-of-2014-new-classical-music/wolfe.jpg"><img class="alignleft wp-image-4755 size-thumbnail" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/best-of-2014-new-classical-music/wolfe-150x150.jpg" alt="wolfe" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/best-of-2014-new-classical-music/wolfe-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/best-of-2014-new-classical-music/wolfe-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/best-of-2014-new-classical-music/wolfe.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a><strong>#2. </strong></p>
<p class="western"><strong>Julia Wolfe. Steel Hammer [Cantaloupe]</strong></p>
<p class="western">Julia Wolfe picks apart the many variations of “John Henry” and reconstructs them all into an extraordinary monument. The work burns slowly to begin with—it takes nearly ten minutes just to get done with the first four words—but the fateful race is genuinely climactic. The Bang On A Can All-Stars provide support for the inspired Trio Medieval in a work that&#8217;s billed by the label as “alt-folk”, though to me “epic minimalism” is probably a better pigeon-hole.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="western"><strong>John Luther Adams. Become Ocean [Cantaloupe]</strong></p>
<p class="western">A vast, slowly rolling orchestral work that perfectly lives up to its title. I&#8217;ve heard it described by a baffled listener as “nothing happens”, which is correct only if you think that nothing happens in an ocean. It won this year&#8217;s Pulitzer Prize for music, which I guess in and of itself means little, but “Become Ocean” has the air of an instant classic about it.</p>

<p class="western">While the Renaissance is regarded as having begun in Italy in the 14th century, convention has it that “Renaissance music” begins in the Low Countries and northern France in the 15th. Part of the reason for this discrepancy is that whereas the art and literature of the Renaissance and of the classical period that inspired it had long been studied, the same wasn&#8217;t true of music. Until the 19th century, the music of the past tended to stay in the past, unperformed, and it wasn&#8217;t until the 20th century that there was much general interest in “early music” (broadly, anything before about 1750). Such music had literally to be rediscovered, and the music of trecento Italy simply wasn&#8217;t known about when ideas of “Renaissance music” were first considered. So perhaps Landini and his contemporaries should be called the first Renaissance composers; but convention has sided with the theorist Johannes Tinctoris (c1435-1511), who was dismissive of all music prior to the 15th century and considered music to have been reborn in his time. Spearheading this apparent rebirth were the composers of what&#8217;s called the Franco-Flemish school, beginning with Dufay and Binchois and ending over a century later. Like Dufay, many of these composers spent at least some of their careers in Italy or other parts of Europe, and the widespread diffusion of their works (aided greatly by the invention of printing) helped to create an international style of music. <span id="more-4526"></span>We&#8217;ll be spending several chapters looking at the various developments in both vocal and instrumental music up to the end of the 16th century. To start us off, “The Art of the Netherlands” gives a useful overview of the secular and sacred music of the Franco-Flemish school, and it also provides a classic example of the work done by the pioneers of the early music revival. First issued in 1976, this album, like many others from David Munrow&#8217;s Early Music Consort, presented vivid performances of music that at the time would have been quite foreign to most listeners.</p>
<p class="western"><b><a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/into-the-renaissance/hcmr045requiems.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4532" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/into-the-renaissance/hcmr045requiems.jpg" alt="hcmr045requiems" width="200" height="177" /></a>Ockeghem &amp; la Rue: Requiems. </b><i>Cappella Pratensis.</i> Challenge (<a href="http://www.challengerecords.com/products/1322744539/" target="_blank">link</a>)</p>
<p class="western">Johannes Ockeghem, born sometime in the early 15th century, was a native of Hainaut, a French-speaking part of modern Belgium that was then a Burgundian possession. He entered the French royal chapel in 1452 and served three kings (Charles VII, Louis IX, and Charles VIII); he died in 1497. He was highly praised in his lifetime not just for his compositions but also for his voice—he sang bass, which probably explains his interest in writing bass lines in his polyphony that were more expressive and lower-lying than those of earlier composers. One of Ockeghem&#8217;s distinctions today is that he composed the oldest surviving polyphonic setting of the Requiem, the mass for the dead (a setting by Dufay, mentioned in his will, may have been earlier, but it&#8217;s now lost). It&#8217;s not known when Ockeghem composed his Requiem, and the only extant copy doesn&#8217;t contain the final sections so it&#8217;s also not clear whether he set the whole mass. The setting employs what&#8217;s called paraphrase technique, making use of an elaborated version of a cantus firmus, in this case the tunes being the Gregorian chant settings of the texts. As befits the occasion, it&#8217;s more sombre music than would be heard in other mass settings, and Ockeghem often uses a sparse texture, sometimes with just two voices. Chronologically, the next setting of the Requiem appears to be that of Pierre de la Rue (c1452-1518), a native of Tournai who held various positions in the Low Countries before joining the renowned chapel of the Duchy of Burgundy in 1492, the duchy by now being under the control of the Habsburgs. He also spent some years in Spain in the service of Philip and Joanna of Castile. La Rue&#8217;s Requiem demonstrates that, like Ockeghem, he had a fondness for low voices.</p>

<p class="western">After his death, Ockeghem&#8217;s reputation rested on the technical skills displayed in some of his compositions. One such work is the <i>Missa cuiusvis toni</i>, which gives us the opportunity for a technical interlude that addresses at last an aspect of composition that might well have come up in the first chapter: the medieval modes. The modes corresponded to the scales produced by using only the white notes on a piano keyboard, and there were eight of them, numbered I to VIII and also given names that came from the ancient Greek musical modes, such as Dorian and Phrygian. Unlike our modern keys, which involve fixed pitches (so C major always starts on the pitch we call C), the modes were ways of representing pitch <i>relationships, </i>and they were distinguished by two particular notes: the “final”, which was the pitch on which the melody ended, and the “cofinal” or “dominant” or “reciting tone”, which was the pitch around which the melody was centered. Here&#8217;s the medieval composers&#8217; love of hierarchical organisation again: the eight modes came in four pairs of “authentic” and “plagal” modes, with the two modes of each pair having the same final but differing in their reciting tones. We need go no further into the theory except to remark that two more pairs were added in the 16th century, and it wasn&#8217;t until the 17th century that our familiar system of major and minor scales had become established. Ockeghem&#8217;s <i>Missa cuiusvis toni</i> (Mass in any mode) was composed without clefs, meaning it is singable in any of the four authentic modes, which is quite a feat because the same cadences won&#8217;t work in all modes. Ensemble Musica Nova performs all four versions of the mass, and while it might be conceded that Ockeghem&#8217;s technical achievement will be more obvious to a musicologist than to the general listener, the fact that each version begins at the same pitch makes it easy to hear how the music changes with each mode. It&#8217;s also worth considering whether medieval theorists were onto anything when they said that each of the modes imparted a particular mood to the music.</p>

<p class="western">And so we come to Josquin des Prez (c.1450-1521), who in his own time was seen as the greatest of all composers, and continues to hold an exalted status today. Martin Luther famously called Josquin “the master of the notes&#8230; other composers must do as the notes dictate”, while the Italian diplomat Cosimo Bartoli believed him to be music&#8217;s equivalent of Michelangelo, “alone and without a peer”. More recently Josquin has sometimes been spoken of as the Beethoven of the Renaissance, a towering individual who transformed music. It wasn&#8217;t just Josquin&#8217;s skills that established such a reputation; to some degree you could say he came along at the right time. This was the age of printing (of which we&#8217;ll hear more in a later chapter), which helped spread his music: Josquin was the first composer to have a printed volume devoted exclusively to his work (a collection of masses produced by Petrucci in 1502), and publishers were quite happy to attach his name to other people&#8217;s music to improve sales. Moreover, this was the age of humanism, when music ceased to be regarded as one of the mathematical arts and instead became one of the arts of rhetoric. Music now was less about applying rules and formulas and more about expression. Josquin&#8217;s motets clearly demonstrate this desire to communicate to the listener: rarely do you hear an extended melisma, because the text settings more closely resemble the natural flow of speech such that the music matches the syllables, rather than the syllables being drawn out to fit the music&#8217;s structure. Not only that, but the composer seeks to match the sound of the music with the meaning of the text; listen, for example, to Josquin&#8217;s <i>Miserere mei, Deus</i> (<i>Have mercy on me, O God</i>), with the sparse and plaintive textures of the opening words, repeated several times at different pitches; the clarity of the singing of the verses; and then the full choir returning as the opening words reappear as a refrain. Very few of Josquin&#8217;s compositions can be reliably dated, but this <i>Miserere</i> appears to be have written when he was in the employ of Ercole d&#8217;Este at Ferrara in 1503-4, and was perhaps inspired by the recent execution of the reforming cleric Savonarola.</p>

<p class="western">Josquin&#8217;s masses can be said to be more conservative in style than his motets, but then by their nature mass settings require a greater emphasis on structure. Nevertheless, with mass settings now in demand following the examples of Dufay, Ockeghem and their contemporaries, there was plenty of scope for innovation. The two masses recorded here use secular chansons for their cantus firmi, but in both cases Josquin uses not just one voice of the chanson to construct his mass, as was the norm with cantus firmus masses, but exploits all <i>three</i> voices. The resulting works are known as imitation or parody masses, and by the time of Josquin&#8217;s death the parody mass had begun to replace the cantus firmus mass. The specific technique of imitation, where a phrase in one voice is repeated in another voice, had long been used in music, but it became a prominent aspect of composition in Josquin&#8217;s time, a development that meant all voices in a piece were of equal importance. Because each of the mass movements took its ideas from the entire chanson or motet on which it was based, the mass could take on the characteristics of the model, not just its melodies but also its general structure, thus becoming a more individual work—particularly so if the model itself was already a highly individual piece such as a Josquin motet. Thus, each of Josquin&#8217;s masses can be seen as a distinct utterance in much the same way, Peter Phillips argues in his notes for the Tallis Scholars&#8217; album, as we view the symphonies of Beethoven.</p>

<p class="western">When Josquin got his job in Ferrara, his chief competitor for the position was the Flanders-born Heinrich Isaac; Ercole d&#8217;Este had been advised that Josquin was the better composer but that Isaac was more likely to compose to please his employer rather than himself. Isaac had been in the employ of Lorenzo de&#8217; Medici in Florence, and in 1496 he was appointed court composer (<i>Hofkomponist</i>) to the Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I—the first time anyone had been professionally employed specifically as a composer. Although Maximilian&#8217;s court was based in Vienna, Isaac had the freedom to travel and in fact spent much of the rest of his life (he died in 1517) in Florence. Also unusually among his musical peers, Isaac remained a layman and was married. In terms of surviving music, he&#8217;s rivaled only by Josquin in quantity, and he quite outstrips Josquin in variety. On his travels from Flanders to Italy to Germany, Isaac absorbed many styles, making him the most eclectic composer of his generation. Capilla Flamenca&#8217;s recording presents “a life in music”, following Isaac from a Franco-Flemish mass setting, through such Florentine items as music written for the Carnival, a mashup of local tunes, and a motet marking the death of his patron Lorenzo, to an audition piece for the post in Ferrara, to secular songs in German. It&#8217;s perhaps for his contributions to German music that Isaac&#8217;s fame has been most lasting; he was the first of the Franco-Flemish composers of polyphony to live there, and he helped to popularise the style while also contributing to particular local practices such as the creation of polyphonic settings of Mass Propers. You&#8217;ll recall that we haven&#8217;t mentioned Germany for quite some time in this history, but now it was being brought into the mainstream of European music.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yes, top 23: this was a very good year of classical releases for me, and it turns out that the number of albums I want to mention doesn&#8217;t correspond exactly with the number of fingers and toes I possess. To buck convention even further, I&#8217;m not going to rank the albums, aside from my favourite of the year. The usual provisos apply; the list is some distance away from being representative of the year&#8217;s classical releases as a whole.</p>

Petitgirard: The Little Prince</strong><br />
<strong>Laurent Petitgirard conducting</strong><br />
<strong>(Naxos)</strong></p>
<p>A mysterious, sombre and beautiful ballet from 2010, based on the classic book. Petitgirard makes use of a choir and a handful of instrumentalists; if I describe the music as like a softer, French-accented Philip Glass, this doesn&#8217;t do it justice but at least might give you some idea of the sound-world.</p>

<strong>Daniel Hope</strong><br />
<strong>(Deutsche Grammophon)</strong><br />
OK, if I were assigning numbers to the rest of my list, this one would be #2. Some gorgeous and, let&#8217;s admit cheerfully, radio-friendly music here &#8211; the album&#8217;s aim is to reflect the idea of “the music of the spheres”, which it does through a handful of Baroque pieces and a selection of mostly minimalist modern works.</p>

Rachel Barton Pine<br />
(Cedille)</strong><br />
Beauty is the order of the day, too, with this wonderful collection which, though ostensibly aimed at the “new parents” market, shines enough new light on some familiar pieces (and highlights some less-well-known ones) to justify its existence for any fan of the violin.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/top-23-of-2013-stephen-j-nereffid/wagner.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4356" alt="wagner" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/top-23-of-2013-stephen-j-nereffid/wagner.jpg" width="120" height="120" /></a>“Wagner”<br />
Jonas Kaufmann<br />
(Decca)</strong><br />
2013 marked Wagner&#8217;s bicentenary, and Kaufmann is widely regarded as today&#8217;s leading Wagner tenor, so I suppose that makes this album &#8211; a selection of scenes and arias, plus the <em>Wesendonck Lieder</em>, usually sung by a soprano &#8211; my most “mainstream” album of the year.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/top-23-of-2013-stephen-j-nereffid/mahlergerhaher.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4341" alt="mahlergerhaher" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/top-23-of-2013-stephen-j-nereffid/mahlergerhaher.jpg" width="120" height="120" /></a>Mahler: Orchestral Songs<br />
Christian Gerhaher<br />
(Sony)</strong><br />
Something of a no-brainer, this one: Mahler&#8217;s my favourite composer, and baritone Gerhaher is probably my favourite singer of lieder. This doesn&#8217;t displace some classic recordings &#8211; and actually it&#8217;s not even Gerhaher&#8217;s best Mahler album &#8211; but everything went sufficiently right here, with help from conductor Kent Nagano.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/top-23-of-2013-stephen-j-nereffid/eisler.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4337" alt="eisler" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/top-23-of-2013-stephen-j-nereffid/eisler.jpg" width="120" height="120" /></a>Eisler: Lieder<br />
Matthias Goerne<br />
(Harmonia Mundi)</strong><br />
And if I had to pick a second-favourite baritone it would be Goerne, here singing a selection of songs by long-time Brecht collaborator Hanns Eisler, including his final work, the <em>Serious Songs</em> written in East Berlin in 1961-2.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/top-23-of-2013-stephen-j-nereffid/dvorak.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4336" alt="dvorak" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/top-23-of-2013-stephen-j-nereffid/dvorak.jpg" width="120" height="120" /></a>Dvořák: Stabat Mater<br />
Philippe Herreweghe conducting<br />
(Harmonia Mundi)</strong><br />
I&#8217;ve been listening to classical music long enough now that it&#8217;s unusual to have a first-time encounter with a significant work by one of the great composers. This large-scale choral work was inspired by the deaths of three of Dvořák&#8217;s children; it&#8217;s a dark piece that journeys to light.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/top-23-of-2013-stephen-j-nereffid/songsoldentimes.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4349" alt="songsoldentimes" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/top-23-of-2013-stephen-j-nereffid/songsoldentimes.jpg" width="120" height="120" /></a>“Songs of Olden Times”<br />
Heinavanker<br />
(Harmonia Mundi)</strong><br />
I&#8217;m a sucker for the sound of Estonian choral music, and this collection of “folk hymns and runic songs”, with contributions from conductor/composer Margo Kõlar, hits all the right buttons. Easily the loveliest choral album of the year.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/top-23-of-2013-stephen-j-nereffid/monteverdi.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4343" alt="monteverdi" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/top-23-of-2013-stephen-j-nereffid/monteverdi.jpg" width="120" height="120" /></a>Monteverdi: Heaven and Earth<br />
Robert King<br />
(Vivat)</strong><br />
Conductor Robert King revived his recording career this year with the launch of The King&#8217;s Consort&#8217;s new record label, Vivat. This selection of Monteverdi arias and madrigals certainly feels like the old band getting back together.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/top-23-of-2013-stephen-j-nereffid/iovidiinterra.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4339" alt="iovidiinterra" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/top-23-of-2013-stephen-j-nereffid/iovidiinterra.jpg" width="120" height="120" /></a>“Io vidi in terra”<br />
José Lemos<br />
(Sono Luminus)</strong><br />
Another year, another new countertenor to get excited about. Well, Brazilian José Lemos has been around for a while but this is the first time I&#8217;ve encountered his rich voice. Here he sings a variety of pieces from 17th-century Italy, aided by Jory Vinikour (harpsichord) and Deborah Fox (theorbo).</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/top-23-of-2013-stephen-j-nereffid/telemann.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4351" alt="telemann" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/top-23-of-2013-stephen-j-nereffid/telemann.jpg" width="120" height="120" /></a>Telemann: Hoffnung des Wiedersehens<br />
Dorothee Mields<br />
(DHM)</strong><br />
He wrote so much music, and so little of it is known: Telemann is a gift that keeps on giving. Unlike many collections of baroque opera arias, this one doesn&#8217;t offer vocal pyrotechnics, making it ideal for Mields&#8217;s gently pure soprano.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/top-23-of-2013-stephen-j-nereffid/bachreinvented.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4334" alt="bachreinvented" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/top-23-of-2013-stephen-j-nereffid/bachreinvented.jpg" width="120" height="120" /></a>“Bach Re-invented”<br />
Absolute Ensemble/Kristjan Järvi<br />
(Sony)</strong><br />
Three of Bach&#8217;s keyboard inventions (played by Simone Dinnerstein) provide the launching-pads for new kinda-jazz-rock-fusion-y works by Gene Pritsker, Daniel Schnyder and Tom Trapp. Is it <em>strictly</em> classical? Well, I guess it doesn&#8217;t so much cross boundaries as wholly ignore them.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/top-23-of-2013-stephen-j-nereffid/cassuto.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4335" alt="cassuto" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/top-23-of-2013-stephen-j-nereffid/cassuto.jpg" width="120" height="120" /></a>Cassuto: Return to the Future<br />
Álvaro Cassuto conducting<br />
(Naxos)</strong><br />
Portuguese conductor Cassuto wrote avant-garde music in the sixties, but the four works here from the succeeding two decades demonstrate his whole-hearted embrace of accessible tonality. There&#8217;s a real freshness to this music, notwithstanding its roots in the past.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/top-23-of-2013-stephen-j-nereffid/schafer.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4348" alt="schafer" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/top-23-of-2013-stephen-j-nereffid/schafer.jpg" width="120" height="120" /></a>Schafer: String quartets nos.8-12<br />
Quatuor Molinari<br />
(Atma)</strong><br />
This is my first exposure to the music of R Murray Schafer, five appealing works written over the past dozen years. Eight minutes into the opening track the quartet plays a Shostakovich-like dance accompanied by the sound of children playing; that&#8217;s the sort of thing that hooks me totally.</p>

Minneapolis Guitar Quartet<br />
(Innova)</strong><br />
My tentative explorations of the classical guitar continue with this wonderfully evocative album, from Daniel Roumain&#8217;s music of American “ghettos” through David Evan Thomas&#8217;s relaxed title piece and Van Stiefel&#8217;s messing around with cowboy songs to Gao Hong&#8217;s depictions of life in southern China.</p>

Trombone Unit Hannover<br />
(Genuin)</strong><br />
From guitar quartet to trombone octet&#8230; Brass music isn&#8217;t often on my radar, but this album is an absolute joy. The seven works here, all of them recent or fairly recent, pretty much cover the spectrum from Wagnerian bombast to weird blaarts (but mostly the points in between). This is the most fun album of the year.</p>

Olga Pashchenko<br />
(Fuga Libera)</strong><br />
With the help of a pair of great-sounding fortepianos, Pashchenko messes with our perceptions: here Mendelssohn and the not-so-well-known Dussek are the fiery Romantics, while Beethoven&#8217;s the charming classicist. If my list were confined to dead composers this album would be at the top.</p>

Arcadi Volodos<br />
(Sony)</strong><br />
The small-scale intimacies of Catalan composer Federico Mompou might seem unlikely fare for the Russian “supervirtuoso”, but this is a real ear-opener. Mompou&#8217;s like a warmer Debussy, an earthier Scriabin; Volodos brings fire when needed, but this is mostly music you can bathe in.</p>

Jeroen van Veen<br />
(Brilliant)</strong><br />
A valuable survey of a mostly underrecorded aspect of Pärt&#8217;s music, performed by a pianist who&#8217;s making quite a career from specialising in minimalism. The static beauty of “Für Alina”, which here gets four performances, is fairly typical but not the whole story.</p>

Matan Porat<br />
(Mirare)</strong><br />
Among several mixed-repertoire piano recitals, this debut recording from Israeli composer-performer Porat stood out. A little motif heard in a Scarlatti sonata is the starting point for a journey that ranges from Couperin to Grieg to Boulez. Ingenious.</p>

Mark Padmore, Morgan Szymanski<br />
(Signum)</strong><br />
The English tenor and Mexican guitarist&#8217;s previous recording of the lyrical songs of Alec Roth is one of my favourites, and this one matches it. The settings here are mainly of texts by Vikram Seth and Tudor poet Thomas Wyatt.</p>

Helene Gjerris<br />
(Dacapo)</strong><br />
I still haven&#8217;t quite worked out why it is that I find Per Nørgård&#8217;s music so appealing; perhaps it&#8217;s what Tom Service described as “its simultaneous sense of freedom and coherence”. This collection covers music ranging from the 1950s to the present, including a show-stopping setting of Allen Ginsberg&#8217;s “Plutonian Ode”.</p>

(Orchid)</strong><br />
And finally. This is too good to simply call a novelty release, but in fairness how many of us have listened to Stravinsky&#8217;s <em>Petrushka</em> and thought “oh, if only I could hear it played by an accordion duo”? Well, it turns out this is what we should have been thinking all along.</p>
<p>One other bit of business is to mention my favourite track not found on any of the above albums. “Piers Lane Goes To Town” (Hyperion) is another fine piano recital, this one of encore pieces, my highlight being Lane&#8217;s rendition of Dudley Moore&#8217;s unstoppable Beethoven parody, “And the same to you”.</p>
<p>All that&#8217;s left is for me to indulge in what seems to have become an annual ritual among many classical fans: the satisfied announcement that the supposed death of the classical recording industry has most unequivocally been postponed for another twelve months&#8230;</p>

<p>Although the dukes of Burgundy were nominally vassals of the French king, in the late 14th and 15th centuries they grew in power thanks to useful marriages and land acquisitions, taking advantage also of France&#8217;s difficulties during the Hundred Years War. When Philip the Good became duke in 1419 he inherited not just part of northeastern France but also Flanders and its important commercial centers; over the course of his reign, he added much of the rest of the Low Countries and brought Burgundy to the height of its power. Philip was a great patron of the arts: he appointed the Flemish painter Jan van Eyck to his court, and his chapel of musicians was among the finest in Europe. Because Philip lived mostly in his northern possessions rather than in Dijon, most of his musicians came from Flanders and the Low Countries. One such musician was Gilles de Bins, known as Gilles Binchois, born probably in Mons around 1400, who joined Philip&#8217;s chapel in the 1420s, remaining there until 1453 (he died in 1460). He&#8217;s best known today for his secular French chansons; the dukes of Burgundy were carrying on the medieval courtly tradition, and Binchois&#8217;s chansons are on the continuum stretching back through Machaut to the trouvères. Binchois seems to have been particularly keen on composing by conventional rules: most of his chansons are in <i>rondeau </i>form, with four- or five-line stanzas and two-line refrains, most have lines of eight syllables, and almost all are in triple metre. What made Binchois stand out among his contemporaries were his graceful melodies, combined with a lack of rhythmic complexity. This simple and elegant music seems to lend itself to melancholic expression, as exemplified by Graindelavoix&#8217;s collection of <i>plaintes</i>, or laments. It seems odd to title such an album “Joye”—which comes from Johannes Ockeghem&#8217;s description of Binchois as “the father of joy” in his lament on the death of Binchois, included on the disc—but Björn Schmelzer explains that the “joy” in question is a more profound emotion that relates to “singing out one&#8217;s sadness”: a 15th-century form of the blues, if you like.<span id="more-4085"></span></p>

<p>Guillaume Dufay is widely regarded as the greatest composer of the Burgundian school. Born around 1397, he became a choirboy at the cathedral of Cambrai, where he received both musical and religious training. Dufay had several periods of employment in Italy: he appears to have worked under the Malatesta family in Rimini and/or Pesaro between 1420 and 1426, and he was a singer in the papal choir in Rome from 1428 to 1433; he was also associated with the dukes of Savoy and the Este family in Ferrara. This was yet another troubled time for the papacy: when Dufay returned to the service of Pope Eugene IV in 1435, the pope was in Florence, having fled Rome due to political turbulence; then in 1439, Eugene was formally deposed and replaced by Dufay&#8217;s <i>previous</i> employer, Duke Amadeus VIII of Savoy (whom history now calls an anti-pope). It&#8217;s not surprising that Dufay left the scene and returned to Cambrai, having already been made a canon of the cathedral in 1436; he returned to Savoy in the 1450s, after the papal crisis had ended, and retired back to Cambrai in 1458, by now an eminent figure occasionally visited by other composers. He died in 1474. Some of Dufay&#8217;s travels can be traced in the Huelgas-Ensemble&#8217;s collection of all 13 of his extant isorhythmic motets. Motets of this now long-established style had become associated with ceremonial occasions, as is clear from some examples: <i>Vasilissa ergo gaude</i> was composed in 1420 for a feast in honour of Cleofe Malatesta before her marriage to the brother of the Byzantine emperor; <i>Supremum est mortalibus bonum</i> marks a treaty of 1433 between Pope Eugene and the Holy Roman Emperor; and <i>Nuper rosarum flores</i> was sung at the consecration of the cathedral in Florence in 1436, when Brunelleschi&#8217;s dome was completed.</p>
<p><b><a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/the-burgundian-school/hcmr041dufayflos.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4088" alt="Dufay Flos Florum" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/the-burgundian-school/hcmr041dufayflos.jpg" width="200" height="178" /></a>Dufay: “Flos florum”. </b><em>Ensemble Musica Nova.</em> Zig-Zag Territoires (<a href="http://www.outhere-music.com/en/albums/flos-florum-motets-hymmes-antiennes-dediees-a-la-vierge-zzt050301" target="_blank">link</a>)</p>
<p>Dufay&#8217;s isorhythmic motets represent the last such works, and the move away from isorhythm represents a major shift in composition. In an isorhythmic motet, the composer was creating a complex musical structure based on the durations of the different sections and on their relationships. These structures themselves could be highly symbolic; for example, Dufay&#8217;s <i>Nuper rosarum flores </i>possesses certain durational ratios that correspond to the biblically reported dimensions of the temple of Solomon. In short, isorhythm is all about numbers. In Italy, however, composers had not been especially interested in isorhythmic motets, preferring non-isorhythmic polyphonic forms such as madrigals. With Dufay and various northern contemporaries spending many years in Italy, it&#8217;s unsurprising that they should make use of local styles, and in the evolution of the motet we see not just the disappearance of isorhythm but also a decline in the importance of the tenor voice (upon which the isorhythmic motet depended for its structual foundation), the use of single rather than multiple texts, the use of imitation among voices, and an important role for melody in the creation of the structure. In short, what we see in the first half of the 15th century is a shift from numbers to melody. There was also at the time a reconsideration of the purpose of the motet. The form had originally developed as sacred music to be sung in particular liturgical contexts, but over the years it had drifted somewhat from this purpose. Now, perhaps influenced by practices in England, where there seems to have been less drift, composers were returning the motet to devotional use, with particular emphasis on texts relating to the Virgin Mary. Examples of such pieces can be heard on Ensemble Musica Nova&#8217;s album, along with some hymns and antiphons, genres which generally involved the fairly straightforward harmonisation of an existing chant. A form of harmonisation known as <i>fauxbourdon</i> begins to be seen in some works of Dufay from the 1430s, where the chant is sung in the uppermost voice, doubled a fourth below, and with a third voice singing mostly in parallel sixths (which, we saw in the last chapter, was a stylistic feature of English polyphony). Although <i>fauxbourdon </i>tended to be confined to simpler chant settings, its general features were a major part of the overall Burgundian style of three-part composition, with the two higher voices coupled together in terms of melody and rhythm, producing a more homogenous texture.</p>

<p>In terms of the type of music being composed, the most significant development during the Burgundian period was the appearance of the cyclic mass. We&#8217;ve already seen that Machaut and various anonymous composers of the 14th century had produced complete settings of the Mass Ordinary, but the Burgundians&#8217; inspiration for masses in which all the movements were musically connected appears to have come from England. Complete mass settings in which the movements employ a tenor based on a particular pre-existing chant<i> </i>(referred to as the <i>cantus firmus, </i>or “fixed song”) were composed by Leonel Power and (possibly) John Dunstable, but the crucial work in the development of the cyclic mass is an anonymous composition from around 1440. The <i>Missa Caput</i> derives its name from the fact that in each of the five movements the tenor is based on the hundred-note-long melisma sung to the first syllable of the word <i>caput</i> (meaning “head”) in the antiphon <i>Venit ad Petrum. </i>This antiphon, part of the Sarum rite, pertains to Jesus washing the feet of his disciples and was sung on the Thursday before Easter, though whether this is relevant to the circumstances of the mass&#8217;s composition is unknown. Importantly, the <i>Missa Caput </i>is written for four rather than three voices, the novelty here being the addition of another voice below the tenor, one that was freely composed rather than linked to the tenor, which, because of the way it could affect harmony, prompted a new way of thinking about chord progressions and cadences that ultimately led to the idea of tonality. This low fourth voice was termed the <i>contratenor bassus</i>, to distinguish from the <i>contratenor </i>voice above the tenor, which became the <i>contratenor altus;</i> meanwhile, the top voice, previously called the cantus or triplum, became the <i>superius</i>. You can easily see how we have ended up with the <i>soprano &#8211; alto &#8211; tenor &#8211; bass</i> nomenclature. The <i>Missa Caput </i>made its way around Europe in manuscript form and proved such an inspiration that two composers of different generations—Johannes Ockeghem and Jacob Obrecht—created their own masses using the same cantus firmus (in fact, the original <i>Missa Caput</i> was long thought to be a composition by Dufay).</p>

<p>It wasn&#8217;t long before cantus firmus masses moved away from reliance on plainchant and began to employ other sacred and secular tunes. In the latter category, the most popular source of a cantus firmus was the song <i>L&#8217;homme armé</i> (“The armed man”): more than forty masses that use its tune are known. It has just a single verse, translated as “The armed man must be feared / It has been proclaimed everywhere / That everyone should arm himself / In an iron shirt of mail”. The author of and inspiration for the song are unknown, though it might not be coincidence that it became popular in the period when Europe was shocked by the fall of Constantinople to the Ottoman Turks. That was in 1453; the following year, Philip the Good of Burgundy held the legendary Feast of the Pheasant to rally support for a crusade. Here, we&#8217;re told, the entertainment included an elephant carrying a woman who sang a lament for Constantinople, and a giant pie within which (uncooked) were 28 musicians. No crusade ever materialised. In 1467, Philip the Good was succeeded by his son Charles the Bold, who was particularly associated with <i>L&#8217;homme armé</i>: an anonymous set of six masses based on the song is dedicated to him, and the most popular <i>Missa L&#8217;homme armé</i> of the time was composed by Antoine Busnois (or Busnoys), who was employed in Charles&#8217;s chapel. On the Binchois Consort&#8217;s disc, Busnois&#8217;s mass is coupled with a mass by Petrus de Domarto, thought to be among the earliest cantus firmus masses produced in continental Europe. Despite an apparently high reputation in his lifetime, little is known of Domarto today—not the first time in this series where a patchy historical record might give us pause. As for Charles the Bold, he became embroiled in a series of conflicts and was killed at the Battle of Nancy in 1477; Busnois and the other musicians of his chapel had accompanied him on previous campaigns, but they seem to have avoided this one. Charles&#8217;s death marked the end of Burgundy as a power, but the dominance of Flemish and French composers continued.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s not much extant music from the 14th century or earlier that&#8217;s specifically English. Under the Anglo-Saxons in the 10th and 11th centuries, a repertory of tropes for Gregorian chants was developed, with examples surviving today in manuscripts from Winchester and Canterbury. Among the changes brought by the Norman conquest of 1066 was the replacement of senior clergy by Normans, who imported their own liturgical traditions and introduced what is now called the Sarum rite. This rite was melodically similar (though not identical) to the Roman rite and included certain unique prayers as well as locally significant additions to the calendar. Thanks to the Normans and their successors the Plantagenets (who came to power in 1154 with the accession of Henry II), England was now closely linked to France, politically and culturally. We saw in Chapter 2 that Anonymous IV, the key source of information on Léonin and Pérotin, was an Englishman, and in fact the earliest surviving version of the <i>Magnus liber organi </i>of Notre Dame is one produced for the Augustinians of St. Andrews, Scotland. English composers seem not to have been especially interested in abstract theories of music compared with their French counterparts, however, and a distinctive English musical voice began to develop during the 13th century, one significant feature of which was a preference for thirds and sixths that may reflect an earlier Scandinavian influence. Unfortunately, the Reformation of the 16th century resulted in the destruction of many manuscripts, and the only records of English polyphony in the 12th, 13th, and 14th centuries survive in fragments. The “Worcester fragments” are individual leaves from manuscripts used in Worcester Cathedral; they survived only because they had been recycled for book-binding, and in the 20th century they were gathered together to represent what scholars believe to have been a very rich repertoire of polyphony.<span id="more-3993"></span></p>

<p>The cupboard is rather bare, too, when it comes to secular music. We&#8217;ve already seen that Henry II&#8217;s son, Richard I, was a trouvère, and later nobles and the merchant classes were interested in courtly song as was the case in France, but there&#8217;s no English equivalent of the large body of troubadour and trouvère music possessed by the French. A few examples of Anglo-Norman songs with music exist, as well as some Latin songs similar to those found in the <i>Carmina burana</i>. As for songs written in Middle English, there are very few of these &#8211; around a couple of dozen from before the early 14th century, most of them sacred. (It should be noted here that Anglo-Norman was the official court language until an act of parliament in 1362, which helped pave the way for the development of a distinctive English culture, as exemplified by the works of Geoffrey Chaucer and his contemporaries). One secular song in Middle English is probably the best-known of all medieval music: “Sumer is icumen in”, found in a mid-13th century manuscript. This is a round (or rota) whose text is sung in four voices accompanied by a two-voice repeated phrase that itself is a round &#8211; a complexity that appears to be unique for its time but may well reflect a common practice of polyphonic singing that wasn&#8217;t otherwise written down.</p>

<p>Rather better represented as a particularly English genre is the polyphonic carol. At first &#8211; in the 12th century &#8211; carols (or <i>caroles</i>, as they were called in France) were monophonic dance songs with solo and choral sections. By the 15th century, from which time we finally have some examples of carols, the form had evolved into a two- or three-voice composition that wasn&#8217;t intended for dancing, though the alternating stanza<span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;">–</span>refrain structure remained (the refrain was known as the “burden” and technically speaking wasn&#8217;t the same as what we would now call a chorus). Today we associate carols with Christmas, but medieval carols were associated with various times of the liturgical year, when they were sung as processional music. Moreover, some of them weren&#8217;t religious; one of the best-known carols is the so-called Agincourt Carol, which describes Henry V&#8217;s victory at the battle of that name in 1415. Alamire&#8217;s recording presents the full contents of the oldest extant source of polyphonic carols, the Trinity Carol Roll. Here, instrumentalists have been brought in for additional variety, which perhaps enhances the impression that carols are folk music &#8211; though they&#8217;re more correctly described as art music composed in a popular style.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/medieval-england/hcmr037oldhall.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3997" alt="Old Hall manuscript" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/medieval-england/hcmr037oldhall.jpg" width="200" height="200" srcset="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/medieval-england/hcmr037oldhall.jpg 200w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/medieval-england/hcmr037oldhall-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" /></a>“<b>The Old Hall Manuscript”. </b><i>Hilliard Ensemble. </i>Virgin</p>
<p>The best source of examples of what music was being written by English composers in the late 14th and early 15th centuries is the so-called Old Hall Manuscript. This was compiled for Thomas, the Duke of Clarence and second son of King Henry IV, around 1410-15, with some later additions probably up to about 1420. The manuscript contains 147 pieces of sacred music, arranged thematically: first settings of the Gloria, then antiphons and sequences, followed by settings of the Credo, Sanctus, and Agnus Dei, with some isorhythmic motets at the end (there are no Kyries because in England the Kyrie was sung as plainchant with tropes). Of great benefit to music historians is that about two-thirds of the music is attributed to named composers &#8211; 24 names in all, including two pieces by “Roy Henry”, which (translating from French) is presumably Henry IV or Henry V. Within each group of pieces, there&#8217;s a further arrangement, with settings in the older “descant” style appearing first, notated in score, followed by more modern pieces notated in separate parts; overall, the manuscript shows quite a wide variety of musical styles. The descant (or discant) style often makes use of a plainchant melody, usually in the middle voice (the tenor), harmonized note for note by the other voices. Among the newer works we find the cantilena style, where the melodic focus shifts to the upper (treble) voice, with two supporting voices that are usually less ornate and sometimes instrumental; another foreign influence is the <i>caccia</i> style used by Pycard to produce Gloria settings in canonic form. In terms of quantity of works, the most significant composer to be found in the Old Hall Manuscript is Leonel Power (died 1445), who was employed at the Duke of Clarence&#8217;s household chapel and may have been involved in the manuscript&#8217;s preparation. Enough of Power&#8217;s music is extant to allow scholars to divide it into earlier and later periods; the pieces in the older part of Old Hall include English discant, isorhythmic Mass movements, and works in the Ars Nova style, whereas the later music shows more consonance and less rhythmic complexity.</p>
<p><b><a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/medieval-england/hcmr038dunstable.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3998" alt="Dunstable" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/medieval-england/hcmr038dunstable.jpg" width="200" height="200" srcset="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/medieval-england/hcmr038dunstable.jpg 200w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/medieval-england/hcmr038dunstable-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" /></a>Dunstable: “Sweet Harmony: Masses and Motets”. </b><i>Tonus Peregrinus.</i> Naxos</p>
<p>Before we go further, we must briefly return to the history of the Church. Although the Avignon papacy had declined in the first years of the 15th century, the great schism continued, and by 1409 there were now three rival popes. Europe had had enough, and 1414 saw the beginning of the four-year Council of Constance, which finally ended the schism. Some 18,000 clerics attended over the course of the council, as did seventeen hundred instrumental musicians, according to the chronicler Ulrich von Richenthal. Of significance for our story here is the arrival in 1416 of two English bishops and their parties, whose celebration of mass created quite an impression among continental musicians with what Ulrich described as “angelic sweet singing” of a style of music they hadn&#8217;t heard before. English music&#8217;s reputation in Europe took a further great boost thanks to the fortuitous arrival in Paris a few years later of John Dunstable (c.1390-1453). Dunstable &#8211; whose name is also spelled Dunstaple &#8211; was in the employ of John of Lancaster, Duke of Bedford, who following the death of his brother King Henry V in 1422 became Regent for the young Henry VI and spent most of the rest of the decade in Paris maintaining England&#8217;s hold on its French possessions. Around fifty of Dunstable&#8217;s works survive, and the majority of them are found only in continental manuscripts. The French were drawn to those distinctively English aspects of Dunstable and his contemporaries&#8217; music &#8211; the flowing rhythms and, especially, the lack of dissonance. Whereas Ars Nova harmonies contained plenty of dissonances, English composers, as we&#8217;ve seen above, had a liking for the consonance provided by major thirds and sixths, and Dunstable was particularly disposed to avoiding dissonance in his music. This approach was so admired that in 1440 the poet Martin le Franc remarked, in an aside in his allegorical poem <i>Le Champion des Dames</i>, that the composers of the time followed the example of Dunstable and “<i>la contenance Angloise</i>” rather than that of their earlier compatriots. A few decades later, the composer Tinctoris described Dunstable and the English composers as essentially the source of what was good in modern music. In the next chapter, we&#8217;ll hear what le Franc and Tinctoris were talking about&#8230;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is the first time I&#8217;ve compiled a personal best of the year, and I realise the resulting list says as much about my buying habits as about my taste in classical music. There&#8217;s little you might call the mainstream classical repertoire, because I don&#8217;t often look for more than one recording of a work, and a tight budget has meant some higher-profile releases never reached my ears; moreover, I&#8217;ve also been filling gaps in my collection with older recordings rather than buying new ones. So, give me a month and a couple of hundred euros and it might be a very different list. But let&#8217;s stick with the excellence at hand. The order of the list has changed repeatedly during the compiling, and would presumably continue to do so if I didn&#8217;t stop now.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-stephen-j-nereffid/12adams.jpg"><img class="alignleft" alt="Adams Harmonielehre" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-stephen-j-nereffid/12adams.jpg" width="150" height="150" /></a>1 <b>John Adams: Harmonielehre</b> <b>&#8211; Michael Tilson Thomas, San Francisco Symphony </b>(SFS Media). In the early 90s, I discovered the music of Gustav Mahler and Philip Glass at roughly the same time. What I didn&#8217;t know then was that a few years earlier John Adams had combined the two (and plenty more besides) in <i>Harmonielehre. </i>The title comes from the treatise of the same name by Schoenberg, but Adams&#8217;s music is a gleeful rejection of Schoenberg&#8217;s aesthetic, a grand mix of influences and references that constantly surprises.<span id="more-3891"></span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-stephen-j-nereffid/12prezioso.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-3950" alt="Preiozoso Quartet" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-stephen-j-nereffid/12prezioso.jpg" width="120" height="120" /></a>2 <b>Prezioso Quartet</b> (ERP). This quartet&#8217;s members are Estonian, and they&#8217;ve been together since 2006. This is their first recording, and it makes a big splash, with a vivid acoustic and some surprising repertoire. Webern&#8217;s highly uncharacteristic <i>Langsamer Satz</i> and an arrangement of a likeable chamber concerto by Estonian Jaan Rääts are framed by a cheerful dance suite by the not-well-enough-known Erwin Schulhoff and the sublime fourth quartet of Peteris Vasks.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-stephen-j-nereffid/12russie.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-3951" alt="Voyage en Russie" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-stephen-j-nereffid/12russie.jpg" width="120" height="120" /></a>3 <b>Voyage en Russie &#8211; Claire-Marie Le Guay</b> (Mirare). Basically, a whole bunch of short Russian piano pieces, with a focus on Rachmaninoff and Scriabin. Some of the “greatest hits” are here, but there&#8217;s plenty of unfamiliar music, and it&#8217;s all captivating. Claire-Marie Le Guay brings everything together into a convincing program, from the opening <i>Flight of the Bumblebee</i> to the closing <i>Vers la flamme,</i> Scriabin&#8217;s astonishing depiction of the heat death of the Earth<i>.</i></p>
<p><a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-stephen-j-nereffid/12tormis.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-3954" alt="Curse Upon Iron" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-stephen-j-nereffid/12tormis.jpg" width="120" height="120" /></a>4 <b>Veljo Tormis: Curse upon Iron</b> <b>&#8211; Orphei Drangar</b> (BIS). Tormis&#8217;s choral music, of which this selection for male voices represents just a small portion, is firmly rooted in the folk music of his native Estonia. Some of it&#8217;s heart-achingly beautiful, while other pieces tap into stronger, darker forces, such as the shamanic title work (adapted from the Kalevala, the Finnish epic poem), full of chanting and pounding drums. An exhilarating experience.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-stephen-j-nereffid/12paris.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-3949" alt="Le Paris des Romantiques" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-stephen-j-nereffid/12paris.jpg" width="120" height="120" /></a>5 <b>Le Paris des Romantiques</b> <b>&#8211; Le Cercle de l&#8217;Harmonie/ Jérémie Rhorer</b> (Ambroisie). It&#8217;s hard to decide what&#8217;s the highlight of this imaginary concert from Paris circa 1850, played on period instruments. On the one hand we&#8217;ve got the beautifully clear performance of Liszt&#8217;s first piano concerto, with Bertrand Chamayou playing an 1837 Érard. On the other, there&#8217;s Napoléon Henri Reber&#8217;s fourth symphony, which manages the neat trick of coming across like a long-lost Beethoven composition while simultaneously sounding utterly fresh.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-stephen-j-nereffid/12morava.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-3947" alt="Morava" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-stephen-j-nereffid/12morava.jpg" width="120" height="120" /></a>6 <b>Morava &#8211; </b><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Š</b></span></span></span><b>kampa Quartet</b> (Supraphon). I kind of surprise myself by having a second quartet disc in my top ten. Most of this release is taken up by the three string quartets of Pavel Fischer, all of which are greatly inspired by folk music from Moravia and elsewhere and full of fascinating twists and turns; the most magical moment is in the quartet &#8220;Wild Mountain Thyme&#8221;, where that Scottish song suddenly emerges at the end of the middle movement. There&#8217;s also a quirky quartet from violinist/singer Iva Bittová, who herself sings on a couple of other pieces.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-stephen-j-nereffid/12shankar.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-3953" alt="Shankar Symphony" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-stephen-j-nereffid/12shankar.jpg" width="120" height="120" /></a>7 <b>Ravi Shankar: Symphony</b> <b>&#8211; London Philharmonic/David Murphy</b> (LPO). Shankar&#8217;s symphony is indeed a four-movement structure modeled on the traditional classical symphony but employs raga scales and makes considerable use of the sitar, played here by his daughter Anoushka (this is a recording of the work&#8217;s premiere in 2010). I know next to nothing about Indian music so all I can report is that this “sounds Indian”, and I guess it&#8217;s this aspect of the work that lends it a general post-minimalist feel.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-stephen-j-nereffid/12weinberg6.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-3956" alt="Weinberg Symphony 6" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-stephen-j-nereffid/12weinberg6.jpg" width="120" height="120" /></a>8 <b>Mieczyslaw Weinberg: Symphony no.6</b> <b>&#8211; Vladimir Lande</b> (Naxos). Weinberg&#8217;s star continues to rise, though my explorations are at an early stage and I&#8217;m still inclined to fall back on the description “sounds quite like Shostakovich, with a bit of Mahler thrown in”. In the Sixth Symphony, the composer&#8217;s gift for orchestration is dramatically enhanced by the presence of a boys&#8217; chorus in three of the movements; the music is increasingly troubled but ends with a hopeful lullaby.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-stephen-j-nereffid/12koshkin.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-3945" alt="Papandreou plays Koshkin" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-stephen-j-nereffid/12koshkin.jpg" width="120" height="120" /></a>9 <b>Elena Papandreou plays Nikita Koshkin</b> (BIS). An intriguing collection of new guitar music from the Russian guitarist/composer, three of the four pieces being written for Papandreou. The lengthy Megaron Concerto is a mostly sombre work, though it sports a very catchy second movement. The quintet for guitar and strings is also rather dark-hued; it&#8217;s all in a thoroughly accessible idiom but you&#8217;ll never mistake it for Boccherini! Overall, an album that patiently creeps up on you.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-stephen-j-nereffid/12beethoven.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-3940" alt="Diabelli Variations" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-stephen-j-nereffid/12beethoven.jpg" width="120" height="120" /></a>10 <strong>Beethoven: Diabelli variations &#8211; Andreas Staier</strong> (Harmonia Mundi). Beethoven&#8217;s epic adventure brought to spectacular life by Staier, who plays a copy of a Beethoven-era Graf fortepiano that comes with some surprising sound-effects features. These provide bonus entertainment but Staier&#8217;s playing is, of course, the main event. For good measure we get ten other composers&#8217; contributions to Diabelli&#8217;s project; the effort by 13-year-old Franz Liszt is hilariously easy to pick from the line-up.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-stephen-j-nereffid/12merton.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-3946" alt="Advent at Merton" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-stephen-j-nereffid/12merton.jpg" width="120" height="120" /></a>11 <b>Advent at Merton &#8211; Choir of Merton College, Oxford</b> (Delphian). I&#8217;ll freely admit that English church choirs aren&#8217;t usually something I enjoy, so this one came as a surprise. It&#8217;s a collection of old and new pieces, including seven antiphons commissioned from the likes of John Tavener, Rihards Dubra, and Gabriel Jackson by Merton College&#8217;s chaplain. Old and new combine beautifully in Jan Sandstrom&#8217;s hypnotic reworking of <em>Es ist ein Ros entsprungen</em><em>, </em>but it&#8217;s gorgeous music all round.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-stephen-j-nereffid/12himmels.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-3943" alt="Himmels-lieder" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-stephen-j-nereffid/12himmels.jpg" width="120" height="120" /></a>12 <b>Himmelslieder &#8211; Franz Vitzthum</b> (Christophorus). An excellent countertenor, in a program of German Baroque cantatas and songs. The collector in me is delighted to add some new composers to the library (Johann Augustin Kobelius and Johann Hildebrand, anyone?); the music lover is thrilled to hear Franz Vitzthum&#8217;s ethereal purity—it floats like no other countertenor I can think of—and the Capricornum Consort Basel&#8217;s sympathetic support.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-stephen-j-nereffid/12bach.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-3939" alt="Bach guitar" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-stephen-j-nereffid/12bach.jpg" width="120" height="120" /></a>13 <b>Bach guitar transcriptions &#8211; Graham Anthony Devine</b> (Naxos). The miracle of Bach&#8217;s music is that it can be adapted to pretty much any instrument and still sound wonderful. Graham Anthony Devine himself has arranged the fourth cello suite and second violin partita, among other works, and the results seem wholly natural; comparison to the originals is pointless, as this is fine, expressive playing that stands on its own merits.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-stephen-j-nereffid/12josquin.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-3944" alt="Josquin" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-stephen-j-nereffid/12josquin.jpg" width="120" height="120" /></a>14 <b>Josquin Desprez: Missa Ave maris stella</b> <b>&#8211; Weser Renaissance/Manfred Cordes</b> (CPO). My medieval and renaissance listening this year has mostly been confined to older recordings as I slowly work my way through my <i>History of Classical Music</i>. This is a lovely collection, sung by male voices only, of a mass and several motets by &#8211; as I&#8217;ll hopefully soon get round to describing him &#8211; the greatest of the Franco-Flemish composers.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-stephen-j-nereffid/12oriada.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-3948" alt="Ó Riada" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-stephen-j-nereffid/12oriada.jpg" width="120" height="120" /></a>15 <b>Seán Ó Riada: Orchestral works</b> (RTÉ). Seán Ó Riada was an important figure in Irish music who died too young, at age 40 in 1971. This is a collection of several orchestral works, including his landmark score for the documentary film <i>Mise Éire, </i>making use of various well-known Irish tunes, and the vibrant <i>Hercules Dux Ferrariae</i>, which combines twelve-note rows with a theme by Josquin and no longer sounds like the forbidding piece I thought it was when I first heard it as a teenager.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-stephen-j-nereffid/12dowland.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-3941" alt="Dowland in Dublin" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-stephen-j-nereffid/12dowland.jpg" width="120" height="120" /></a>16 <b>Dowland in Dublin &#8211; Michael Slattery &amp; La Nef </b>(Atma). This album takes as its starting point the suggestion (not well supported, it must be said) that English Renaissance composer John Dowland was in fact an Irishman. Here, the American tenor Michael Slattery joins forces with Canadian baroque ensemble La Nef to present some of Dowland&#8217;s lighter music with a distinctly Celtic flavour. There have been sniffs from some quarters that this isn&#8217;t &#8220;authentic&#8221;, which rather misses the point.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-stephen-j-nereffid/12vivaldi.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-3955" alt="La Cetra" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-stephen-j-nereffid/12vivaldi.jpg" width="120" height="120" /></a>17 <b>Antonio Vivaldi: La Cetra &#8211; Rachel Podger</b><strong> &amp; Holland Baroque Society</strong> (Channel). These twelve concertos aren&#8217;t among Vivaldi&#8217;s most popular, but one listen will make you wonder why. Rachel Podger and the Holland Baroque Society are clearly having a ball here, with music full of incident and invention. We all know there&#8217;s more to Vivaldi than the Four Seasons, but it&#8217;s nice to be vividly reminded. Of the twelve concertos, is there a highlight? Um&#8230; all of them?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-stephen-j-nereffid/12weinberg20.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-3957" alt="Weinberg Symphony 20" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-stephen-j-nereffid/12weinberg20.jpg" width="120" height="120" /></a>18 <b>Mieczyslaw Weinberg: Symphony no.20; Cello concerto</b> (Chandos). More Weinberg! Thord Svedlund and the Gothenburg Symphony Orchestra&#8217;s recording of Weinberg&#8217;s Third Symphony was my first introduction to the symphonies and became an instant favourite, and their follow-up is also impressive. The symphony (written in 1988) is a dark work that gradually tightens its grip on the listener, while the cello concerto has a beautiful, lyrical first movement that should be much better known.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-stephen-j-nereffid/12say.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-3952" alt="Istanbul Symphony" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-stephen-j-nereffid/12say.jpg" width="120" height="120" /></a>19 <b>Fazil Say: Istanbul Symphony </b>(Naive). Fine musical picture-painting from the Turkish pianist/composer. The Istanbul Symphony is, in Say&#8217;s words, a picture of “a nostalgic, dreamy, vintage Istanbul” that makes use of Turkish instruments alongside the Western symphony orchestra. Its partner on the disc is the Hezarfen Concerto for ney (a Turkish flute, played by Burcu Karadağ) commemorating the man who is claimed to have glided across the Bosphorus in 1632 using wings of his own construction.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-stephen-j-nereffid/12goethe.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-3942" alt="Goethe Lieder" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/top-20-of-2012-stephen-j-nereffid/12goethe.jpg" width="120" height="120" /></a>20<b> Goethe Lieder &#8211; Marlis Petersen</b> (Harmonia Mundi). Schubert and Wolf are the obvious choices for a program of Goethe settings, and they&#8217;re here, but the particular value of this set comes from the appearance of less-obvious pieces, with composers ranging from Fanny Mendelssohn to Charles Ives to Manfred Trojahn. Multiple versions of “Wanderers Nachtlied” shed light on how different composers deal with the same text.</p>
<p>Finally, I must highlight two pieces of music from albums that didn&#8217;t make the cut. Pedro Sanjuán was a Basque conductor and composer who spent a decade in Cuba. The slow movement of his orchestral work <i>Castilla</i> is a gorgeous, sinuous piece with a saxophone tune that&#8217;s a first cousin of Ravel&#8217;s <i>Bolero</i>. The rest of the album from the Basque National Orchestra is fine, but this movement—<i>En la llanura—</i>gets my award for favourite individual track of the year.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the award for best musical depiction of a dog in a spaceship goes to Jon Øivind Ness&#8217;s <i>Zvezdochka in Orbit,</i> an alarmingly vivid portrait for cello and wind band of what Yuri Gagarin&#8217;s immediate predecessor might have experienced in her capsule. It heads a very varied program played by Ernst Simon Glazer and the Norwegian Navy Band, which includes Friedrich Gulda&#8217;s entertainingly daft concerto.</p>

Ars Musici</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve seen already in this history that Dante Alighieri (c1265-1321) was a great admirer of the troubadours, and this opinion held true among the Italian aristocracy generally. Troubadours and joglars, including those fleeing the Albigensian crusade in the early part of the 13th century, had been welcome at the Italian courts, and the local musicians who succeeded them not only imitated their musical style but also continued to set verses in Occitan. Aside from the spiritual <em>laude</em> there was no tradition of Italian song in the vernacular. Around 1306, Dante wrote his treatise <em>De vulgari eloquentia, </em>in which he cited the troubadours as well as classical poets as exemplars in his attempt to devise rules for the creation of vernacular poetry. He also suggested that poetry and music should be distinct &#8211; that profound poems of the high style shouldn&#8217;t be set to music because this would distract from the text, whereas pastoral, descriptive poetry would be ideal for those who wished to compose great music. It&#8217;s not until the 1330s that we see the flowering of vernacular Italian art song, in the form of a genre called the <em>madrigale</em> (which may be translated as meaning “in the mother tongue”), practiced most notably by Jacopo da Bologna, Giovanni da Cascia, and Maestro Piero in the northern cities of Verona and Milan in the 1340s and 1350s. In its formal structure, the madrigal comprised several three-line stanzas, each of them with the same music, with a short <em>ritornello</em> to conclude, this being one or two lines with new music and a different meter; madrigals invariably had a rustic subject, inspired by the bucolic images of classical poets such as Virgil. Unlike vernacular songs elsewhere, the madrigal was a polyphonic form from its inception, although it&#8217;s not certain whether it evolved from monophonic songs with accompaniment or had its origin in 12th-century conductus, which it in some way resembles. One notable musical feature of the madrigal is the presence of long melismas at the very start and very end, but not in between so that the text could easily be understood. Related to the madrigal was the <em>caccia,</em> written for two equal voices in canon, often with an accompanying instrumental part; although the <em>caccia</em> had the same poetic structure as a madrigal, musically it was quite different<em>.<span id="more-3604"></span></em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/trecento-italy/hcmr030landini.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3610" title="A Laurel for Landini" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/trecento-italy/hcmr030landini.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="200" srcset="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/trecento-italy/hcmr030landini.jpg 200w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/trecento-italy/hcmr030landini-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" /></a>“<strong>A Laurel for Landini”. </strong><em>Gothic Voices; Andrew Lawrence-King. </em>Avie (<a href="http://www.avie-records.com/album_detail.php?id=446" target="_blank">link</a>)</p>
<p>The wider social context sheds light on the development of <em>trecento</em> music generally. The universities of northern Italy were centers for law rather than theology, which meant that academics were not usually clerics; moreover, the Italians did not share the Parisians&#8217; interest in combining music with mathematics, and so there was no environment for the isorhythmic motet to thrive. The pope was absent from Italy for much of the 14th century, and there was greater participation by laypeople in religious observances, the musical needs of which were served by the popular <em>laude</em> described in Part 4. The secular relation of the <em>lauda</em> in the 13th century was the <em>ballata, </em>a monophonic song with choral refrains that was performed to accompany dancing. The <em>ballata</em> developed as a lyrical form but also remained in its popular guise, as seen in Boccaccio&#8217;s <em>Decameron, </em>written in Florence in the early 1350s, which depicts the singing of <em>ballate</em> as part of the evening&#8217;s entertainment. Florence was a republic, and its rulers were businessmen rather than nobles, which may help explain why the ballata, with its origins in folk music, rose to prominence as a musical art form here in the 1360s, joining the madrigal and <em>caccia</em> as the three types of secular compositions of <em>trecento</em> Italy. No musical examples of early <em>ballate</em> exist, and there are only a handful of monophonic pieces: like the madrigal, the <em>ballata </em>as art-song was essentially a polyphonic form. The most significant composer of <em>ballate </em>&#8211; and the one with the largest number of works that have survived &#8211; was Francesco Landini (ca. 1325-97), a painter&#8217;s son, blind from childhood as a result of smallpox, who worked as an organist and was renowned for his virtuosity on this and other instruments. Of his 140 or so <em>ballate</em> (he also wrote a small number of madrigals), about two-thirds (presumed to be the earlier ones) are in two-part form and somewhat resemble madrigals, while the rest are in three parts, many of them being for solo voice with two accompanying parts and resembling French ballades.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/trecento-italy/hcmr031dance.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3611" title="Chominciamento di gioia" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/trecento-italy/hcmr031dance.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="200" srcset="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/trecento-italy/hcmr031dance.jpg 200w, https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/trecento-italy/hcmr031dance-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" /></a>“<strong>Chominciamento di gioia”. </strong><em>Ensemble Unicorn. </em>Naxos (<a href="http://www.naxos.com/catalogue/item.asp?item_code=8.553131" target="_blank">link</a>)</p>
<p>The sort of music that the characters of <em>The Decameron</em> might have danced to can be found in a late 14th-century manuscript with the unmemorable title of British Library, Additional 29987.<em> </em>This source contains over 100 pieces of trecento music, of which fifteen are monophonic dances. Eight of these dances resemble the French <em>estampie</em> (the Italian word is <em>istanpitta</em>), and they all bear distinct titles that, according to the writer of Naxos&#8217;s liner notes, may make them the earliest known examples of programmatic music. There are also four shorter pieces labelled <em>saltarello</em> and another called <em>trotto, </em>names that come from the Italian words for jump and trot, respectively, indicating a lively tempo. Finally come two slow pieces, <em>Lamento di Tristano</em> and <em>La Mafredina</em>, each of which is followed by a faster variant called <em>La Rotta</em>. In <em>The Decameron,</em> Boccaccio mentions the lute, fiddle, and bagpipes, but the pieces in Ms. 29987 bear no indication as to how they should be played, and so as with the French dances of the troubadour age, today&#8217;s performers make their own decisions.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/trecento-italy/hcmr032fiori.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3607" title="I dilettosi fiori" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/trecento-italy/hcmr032fiori.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="182" /></a>“<strong>I dilettosi fiori”. </strong><em>Corina Marti. </em>Ramée (<a href="https://outhere-music.com/store-RAM_1108" target="_blank">link</a>)</p>
<p>The diversity of approaches to medieval instrumental music can clearly be seen by comparing the albums by Ensemble Unicorn and Corina Marti. Whereas the band makes considerable use of percussion and occasionally deploys some atmospheric instrumental effects, Marti relies solely on her recorder in the four pieces from Ms. 29987 played here. Most of the other works on this album come from an early 15th-century manuscript called the Codex Faenza, which represents the oldest known collection of keyboard music (the 14th-century Robertsbridge Codex also contains keyboard music, but this is a two-leaf fragment). The 14th century saw the development of stringed keyboard instruments, the clavichord and harpsichord; until that time, the only keyboard instruments were the various types of organ, from the small portative organ that could sit on the player&#8217;s thigh to the large organs installed in churches, described by Guillaume de Machaut as “the king of instruments”. Corina Marti plays the earliest version of the harpsichord, called the clavisimbalum. The Codex Faenza includes keyboard adaptations of secular music by known composers including Machaut, Jacopo da Bologna, and Landini, as well as pieces based on chants for the Mass.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/trecento-italy/hcmr033saracen.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3608" title="The Saracen and the Dove" src="https://www.metelaifne.ga//wp/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/trecento-italy/hcmr033saracen.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="197" /></a>“<strong>The Saracen and the Dove”. </strong><em>Orlando Consort. </em>Archiv (<a href="http://www.orlandoconsort.com/Saracen_and_Dove.htm" target="_blank">link</a>)</p>
<p>The resemblance between Landini and his contemporaries&#8217; <em>ballata</em> and the French ballade wasn&#8217;t coincidental, and may well have been a response to changes in public taste. There was considerable cultural interchange between Florence and the French-speaking world, not just among bankers and businessmen but also among clerics at the papal court in Avignon (and, from 1377, at Rome too). Although the Italians and French used different systems of notation, the Italian system &#8211; as set out by Marchetto of Padua in a treatise of 1319 &#8211; allowed for the use of French features, and the Italian madrigal composers would often combine French and Italian meters in their compositions, giving the pieces great rhythmic richness. As the century progressed, the gallicization of Italian music increased as Italian composers adopted more of the French style as well as French notation. But there was also an Italian influence on French music. Many of the <em>Ars subtilior</em> composers in France were Italians, and they found that certain features of the Italian system were useful for the complex notation required by their compositions. The close of the 14th century saw a further aspect of international exchange, with the appearance of French and Flemish composers at Italian courts. One such was Johannes Ciconia, born and educated in Liège, who, it is thought, was employed by the Viscontis at Pavia in the 1390s before moving on to the cathedral of Padua in 1401. In his music we can hear <em>Ars nova, Ars subtilior</em>, and the Italian style, and the fusion of these styles pointed the way to the &#8216;international&#8217; style of the 15th century. The final component of this mix will be the subject of the next chapter: England.</p>
