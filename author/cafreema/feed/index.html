				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/photo-review-soundset-2015/DSC_04971.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-5096"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5096" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/photo-review-soundset-2015/DSC_04971-300x195.jpg" alt="Vince Staples" width="600" height="389" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/photo-review-soundset-2015/DSC_04971-300x195.jpg 300w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/photo-review-soundset-2015/DSC_04971-1024x664.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p>Saw a lot of live music this year, with well over 100 different bands represented.  These were the best of the bunch:<span id="more-5319"></span></p>
<p class="UFICommentBody _1n4g"><strong>15. <span data-ft="{&quot;tn&quot;:&quot;K&quot;}"><span class="UFICommentBody _1n4g">Wand: November 5, 2015 &#8211; 7th Street Entry</span></span></strong></p>
<p class="UFICommentBody _1n4g">Wand showed up in the Entry and blew the doors off the place.  A technically very talented band, Wand is able to transfer their skills from the studio to the stage better than a vast majority of similar bands.</p>
<p><strong>14. <span data-ft="{&quot;tn&quot;:&quot;K&quot;}"><span class="UFICommentBody _1n4g">Miguel: August 15, 2015 &#8211; State Theater</span></span></strong></p>
<p>Miguel is an incredible performer with magnificent stage presence.  His only real negative is a tendency towards unnecessary, and eye rolling, preachiness.  The show was moved from First Avenue due to a ceiling collapse, otherwise it would likely rank higher.</p>
<p><strong>13. <span data-ft="{&quot;tn&quot;:&quot;K&quot;}"><span class="UFICommentBody _1n4g">White Lung: June 11, 2015 &#8211; 7th Street Entry</span></span></strong></p>
<p>There are few things in this world as invigorating as a truly blazing punk show, and White Lung qualifies.  Mish Way is a banshee of a frontwoman, and the band absolutely crushed it.</p>
<p><strong>12. <span data-ft="{&quot;tn&quot;:&quot;K&quot;}"><span class="UFICommentBody _1n4g">Hot Chip: May 30, 2015 &#8211; First Avenue</span></span></strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s difficult to comprehend the vast number of great songs in Hot Chip&#8217;s catalog until you hear them all at the same time.  It makes for a seriously fun show, especially when capped off by a Springsteen cover.</p>
<p><strong>11. <span data-ft="{&quot;tn&quot;:&quot;K&quot;}"><span class="UFICommentBody _1n4g">TV on the Radio: July 30, 2015 &#8211; First Avenue</span></span></strong></p>
<p>TV on the Radio doesn&#8217;t mess around with gimmicks.  They just take the stage and rock the audience&#8217;s socks off.  In this instance, however, they did close with one of the best of the many &#8216;Purple Rain&#8217; covers played in the Mainroom.</p>
<p><strong>10. <span data-ft="{&quot;tn&quot;:&quot;K&quot;}"><span class="UFICommentBody _1n4g">Vince Staples: December 13, 2015 &#8211; Fine Line</span></span></strong></p>
<p>On <em>Summertime &#8217;06</em>, Vince Staples comes across as a survivor.  He&#8217;s a guy who can grow up surrounded by pain, but make it through.  In concert it becomes clear that in addition to this, he&#8217;s a truly funny guy, and the combination of humor and pain makes for a fascinating show.</p>
<p><strong>9. <span data-ft="{&quot;tn&quot;:&quot;K&quot;}"><span class="UFICommentBody _1n4g">Algiers: June 16, 2015 &#8211; Triple Rock</span></span></strong></p>
<p>Algiers played this show before about 30 people, but you wouldn&#8217;t have known it from their performance.  The energy level was off the charts (especially from bassist Ryan Mahan), which added to the already existing urgency in the band&#8217;s gospel, post punk.</p>
<p><strong>8. <span data-ft="{&quot;tn&quot;:&quot;K&quot;}"><span class="UFICommentBody _1n4g">Titus Andronicus: October 9, 2015 &#8211; Triple Rock</span></span></strong></p>
<p>One of the best rock bands going right now, Titus Andronicus always brings it live, and the TMLT tour was no exception (even if they were distracted by the Mets in the World Series).  A great rock show with a crowd that couldn&#8217;t get enough.</p>
<p><strong>7. <span data-ft="{&quot;tn&quot;:&quot;K&quot;}"><span class="UFICommentBody _1n4g">The Replacements: May 2, 2015 &#8211; The Rave</span></span></strong></p>
<p>A ballroom in Milwaukee is no Midway Stadium filled to bursting, but any opportunity to see Paul Westerberg, Tommy Stinson, and crew play those songs is a gift.  Sadly we might have seen the last of The Mats.</p>
<p><strong>6. <span data-ft="{&quot;tn&quot;:&quot;K&quot;}"><span class="UFICommentBody _1n4g">Big Star&#8217;s Third: September 30, 2015 &#8211; First Avenue</span></span></strong></p>
<p>A performance of Big Star&#8217;s <em>Third</em>, plus the &#8216;hits,&#8217; featuring Big Star&#8217;s Jody Stephenson, The dB&#8217;s Chris Stamey, The Posies&#8217; Ken Stringfellow, R.E.M.&#8217;s Mike Mills, and many, many others. It was an absolute joy to hear this songs live.</p>
<p><strong>5. <span data-ft="{&quot;tn&quot;:&quot;K&quot;}"><span class="UFICommentBody _1n4g">Run the Jewels: October 23, 2015 &#8211; First Avenue</span></span></strong></p>
<p>RtJ has done basically the same show for the last two years, but it doesn&#8217;t matter.  The energy and comradery between Killer Mike and El-P is overwhelming and infectious.  Add that to the fire that is RtJ songs, and it&#8217;s a great night no matter how many times you&#8217;ve seen it.</p>
<p><strong>4. <span data-ft="{&quot;tn&quot;:&quot;K&quot;}"><span class="UFICommentBody _1n4g">Stevie Wonder: March 29, 2015 &#8211; Target Center</span></span></strong></p>
<p>Stevie Wonder brought more than 40 musicians to the stage, including India.Arie, and performed <em>Songs in the Key of Life</em> in its entirety before finishing with some hits, including a show stopping performance of &#8220;Superstition&#8221;.  If it hadn&#8217;t been in an arena this would be #1 by far.</p>
<p><strong>3. <span data-ft="{&quot;tn&quot;:&quot;K&quot;}"><span class="UFICommentBody _1n4g">Kraftwerk: October 7, 2015 &#8211; Northrop</span></span></strong></p>
<p>Four old German guys in funny spandex outfits standing in front of early 80s 3D technology shouldn&#8217;t be great, but it absolutely is.  Then they brought out the robots.  Kraftwerk are true legends and they do what they do very, very well.</p>
<p><strong><span data-ft="{&quot;tn&quot;:&quot;K&quot;}"><span class="UFICommentBody _1n4g">2. Sleater-Kinney: February 14, 2015 &#8211; First Avenue</span></span></strong></p>
<p>They haven&#8217;t lost anything.  Carrie Brownstein still wails on the guitar while doing high kicks, Janet Weiss still crushes the drums, and Corin Tucker&#8217;s voice might be better than ever (she was especially devastating on &#8220;Gimme Love&#8221;).  The crowd was in ecstasy throughout.</p>
<p><strong><span data-ft="{&quot;tn&quot;:&quot;K&quot;}"><span class="UFICommentBody _1n4g">1. Father John Misty: April 4, 2015 &#8211; First Avenue</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span data-ft="{&quot;tn&quot;:&quot;K&quot;}"><span class="UFICommentBody _1n4g">The hype surrounding a Father John Misty live show is immense.  It would be very easy for Josh Tillman to dial it back a bit and still leave the crowd happy, but he refuses to do so.  He puts absolutely everything he has into every note, every gesture, and every word with the crowd.  It&#8217;s a remarkable thing to witness, and if you haven&#8217;t yet done so, you must.<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>25. Waxahatchee – <em>Ivy Tripp</em></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-april-7-2015/Waxahatchee-Ivy-Tripp.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-4971"><img class="alignleft wp-image-4971 size-thumbnail" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-april-7-2015/Waxahatchee-Ivy-Tripp-150x150.jpg" alt="Waxahatchee - Ivy Tripp" width="150" height="150" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-april-7-2015/Waxahatchee-Ivy-Tripp-150x150.jpg 150w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-april-7-2015/Waxahatchee-Ivy-Tripp.jpg 280w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a><em>Ivy Tripp </em>is DIY singer/songwriter that draws on Katie Crutchfield&#8217;s punk past.  Lyrically, the album continues her exploration of feminist ideas, and uses her experiences, or more specifically her mistakes, to demonstrate how a strong, independent woman is formed in today’s society.<span id="more-5262"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>24. Speedy Ortiz – <em>Foil Deer</em></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-april-21-2015/Speedy-Ortiz-Foil-Deer.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-4976"><img class="alignleft wp-image-4976 size-thumbnail" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-april-21-2015/Speedy-Ortiz-Foil-Deer-150x150.jpg" alt="Speedy Ortiz - Foil Deer" width="150" height="150" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-april-21-2015/Speedy-Ortiz-Foil-Deer-150x150.jpg 150w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-april-21-2015/Speedy-Ortiz-Foil-Deer.jpg 280w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a>Speedy Ortiz’s previous releases were enjoyable, but often lacked the hooks to take the band to the next level.  <em>Foil Deer</em> does not have that deficiency. It has hooks for days.  Sadie Dupuis’ voice and the album’s guitar tones bring to mind 90s artists like Liz Phair and Veruca Salt, but <em>Foil Deer</em> is noise pop for this generation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>23. Chvrches – <em>Every Open Eye</em></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-25-of-2015-craig-mcmanus/Chvrches-Every-Open-Eye.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-5266"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5266" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-25-of-2015-craig-mcmanus/Chvrches-Every-Open-Eye-150x150.jpg" alt="Chvrches - Every Open Eye" width="150" height="150" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-25-of-2015-craig-mcmanus/Chvrches-Every-Open-Eye-150x150.jpg 150w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/top-25-of-2015-craig-mcmanus/Chvrches-Every-Open-Eye.jpg 280w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a>The best word to describe <em>Every Open Eye </em>is &#8216;pristine.&#8217;  The album sees Chvrches bring their brand of indie, synth pop ever closer to the pop mainstream.  In fact, there is no doubt that a little Top 40 radio airplay would see the band deservedly break through that barrier.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>22. Young Thug – <em>Barter 6</em></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-april-21-2015/Young-Thug-Barter-6.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-4977"><img class="alignleft wp-image-4977 size-thumbnail" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-april-21-2015/Young-Thug-Barter-6-150x150.jpg" alt="Young Thug - Barter 6" width="150" height="150" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-april-21-2015/Young-Thug-Barter-6-150x150.jpg 150w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-april-21-2015/Young-Thug-Barter-6.jpg 280w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a><em>Barter 6</em> is Young Thug at his insane best. It’s hooky, full of intricate flows and odd bars, and of course features Thugga’s distinctive voice.  Where this tape stands out among Thug&#8217;s output of the last couple years, however, is the production.  The beats here are almost languid and Thug’s flow often slows down to ride in the pocket.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>21. Lower Dens – <em>Escape From Evil</em></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-march-31-2015/Lower-Dens-Escape-From-Evil.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-4964"><img class="alignleft wp-image-4964 size-thumbnail" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-march-31-2015/Lower-Dens-Escape-From-Evil-150x150.jpg" alt="Lower Dens - Escape From Evil" width="150" height="150" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-march-31-2015/Lower-Dens-Escape-From-Evil-150x150.jpg 150w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-march-31-2015/Lower-Dens-Escape-From-Evil.jpg 280w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a>Lower Dens&#8217; prior releases were heavily indebted to shoegaze/dream pop sounds.<em> Escape From Evil</em>, however, introduces a dancey, new wave aesthetic.  Drums and bass drive the album and give it a bounce that hasn’t existed for the band before. Even with the new direction, however, the band’s music rises and falls with Jana Hunter’s strong alto vocals, and <em>Escape From Evil</em> has far more rise than fall.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>20. Miguel – <em>Wildheart</em></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-june-30-2015/Miguel-Wildheart.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-5154"><img class="alignleft wp-image-5154 size-thumbnail" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-june-30-2015/Miguel-Wildheart-150x150.jpg" alt="Miguel - Wildheart" width="150" height="150" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-june-30-2015/Miguel-Wildheart-150x150.jpg 150w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-june-30-2015/Miguel-Wildheart.jpg 280w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a>Full of guitars, explicit lyrics, and largely shunning obvious hooks to rely on an album wide atmosphere to draw in the listener, <em>Wildheart</em> isn’t about sex.  It is sex.  There&#8217;s really nothing more that needs said.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>The Most Lamentable Tragedy</em> may not be Titus Andronicus’ best album, but due to its in-depth focus on mental illness it is easily their most important.  The lyrics, dark and beautiful, despairing and hopeful, are what frontman Patrick Stickles has been building towards for his entire career, and are devastatingly important.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/the-new-music-friday-3-for-july-31-2015/Titus-Andronicus-The-Most-Lamentable-Tragedy.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5176" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/the-new-music-friday-3-for-july-31-2015/Titus-Andronicus-The-Most-Lamentable-Tragedy.jpg" alt="Titus Andronicus - The Most Lamentable Tragedy" width="280" height="280" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/the-new-music-friday-3-for-july-31-2015/Titus-Andronicus-The-Most-Lamentable-Tragedy.jpg 280w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/the-new-music-friday-3-for-july-31-2015/Titus-Andronicus-The-Most-Lamentable-Tragedy-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 280px) 100vw, 280px" /></a><strong>Titus Andronicus &#8211; <em>The Most Lamentable Tragedy</em></strong></p>
<p><em>The Most Lamentable Tragedy</em> is a double, concept album focusing on a protagonist dealing (like Titus Andronicus frontman Patrick Stickles) with mental illness.  Stickles has been actively working on <em>TMLT</em> for about the last 4 years, but in many ways the album has been foreshadowed (both thematically and musically) for the band&#8217;s entire existence.</p>
<p>Lyrically, <em>TMLT</em> is dark and beautiful, despairing and hopeful, and will move many to tears.  Divided into 5 parts, the lyrics follow the unnamed person through all the ups and downs of manic depression: Breakdown, treatment, prescriptions, the highs and lows that still affect everything you do, and how to connect with your loved ones who, despite their best efforts, can&#8217;t begin to understand what you&#8217;re going through.  Mostly, though, the album is about the internal war between a person and himself, and this war does not have a happy ending.<span id="more-5173"></span></p>
<p>Musically, however, <em>TMLT</em> is everything expected from Titus Andronicus and then some.  There are bar room rockers highlighted by. &#8220;Mr. E. Mann&#8221; and &#8220;Fatal Flaw,&#8221; and there are punk bangers like &#8220;Dimed Out&#8221; and &#8220;(S)He Said, (S)He Said.&#8221;  Most interestingly, though, the sound throughout <em>TMLT</em> has been fleshed out with strings arranged by the fantastic Owen Pallett.  This addition to the band&#8217;s sound allows them to create the closest thing to a pop, love song they&#8217;ve ever released in &#8220;Come On, <span class="a-declarative" data-action="a-popover" data-a-popover="{&quot;closeButton&quot;:&quot;false&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;trackTitlePopover_B0115S3SY0&quot;,&quot;position&quot;:&quot;triggerTop&quot;}">Siobhán.&#8221;  Finally, there are the usual sprawling tracks like &#8220;More Perfect Union&#8221; that combine all these threads and even throw in some Irish pub song for good measure.</span></p>
<p>On the whole,<em> TMLT</em> may not be Titus Andronicus&#8217; best album (that title likely still belongs to <em>The Monitor</em>), but it is easily their most important and will be the album for which they are remembered.  Put quite simply, if this is what Titus Andronicus has been building towards, it&#8217;s a more than worthy capstone to their career no matter where they go from here.</p>
<p><a href="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/the-new-music-friday-3-for-july-31-2015/Migos-Yung-Rich-Nation.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5175" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/the-new-music-friday-3-for-july-31-2015/Migos-Yung-Rich-Nation.jpg" alt="Migos - Yung Rich Nation" width="280" height="280" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/the-new-music-friday-3-for-july-31-2015/Migos-Yung-Rich-Nation.jpg 280w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/the-new-music-friday-3-for-july-31-2015/Migos-Yung-Rich-Nation-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 280px) 100vw, 280px" /></a><strong>Migos &#8211; <em>Yung Rich Nation</em></strong></p>
<p>In the past, labels have tried to rein in mixtape artists in order to create records with something for everyone regardless of whether the artist is capable of changing styles.  On their debut LP, however, Migos sound exactly like they have on the tapes that got them signed in the first place, and this is a very good thing.  <em>Yung Rich Nation</em> finds the trio still trading both verses and bars, still coming up with one or two word hooks and repeating them until you can&#8217;t get them out of your head (people are going to love yelling &#8220;bachelor&#8221; and &#8220;spray the champagne&#8221;), and still going in hard as hell.  The only real difference between <em>YRN</em> and the earlier mixtapes is the production.  It feels sparser here and does a great job adding to the group&#8217;s flow without overwhelming it.  The combination is excellent and makes for a really fun listen.</p>
<p><a href="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/the-new-music-friday-3-for-july-31-2015/Gunplay-Living-Legend.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5174" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/the-new-music-friday-3-for-july-31-2015/Gunplay-Living-Legend.jpg" alt="Gunplay - Living Legend" width="280" height="280" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/the-new-music-friday-3-for-july-31-2015/Gunplay-Living-Legend.jpg 280w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/the-new-music-friday-3-for-july-31-2015/Gunplay-Living-Legend-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 280px) 100vw, 280px" /></a><strong>Gunplay &#8211; <em>Living Legend</em></strong></p>
<p>A part of Rick Ross&#8217; Maybach Music Group, Gunplay has been a go-to guy for unhinged, violent features for the better part of a decade, but despite repeated false starts he has never released a solo LP.  In fact, it got to a point where the general consensus was that any LP that did finally come out would be less than stellar, so the expectations for <em>Living Legend</em> were incredibly low.  Happily, the expectations for its follow up will be much higher.  Lyrically <em>Living Legend</em> is hardcore gangsta rap through-and-through, and Gunplay&#8217;s flow is redlined to such an extent you get the feeling his life depends on getting these verses out as fast and loud as possible.  That flow is backed by a bass heavy production (other than the G-Funk of &#8220;Wuzhanindoe feat. YG&#8221;) that adds to the album&#8217;s dark, street feel.  <em>Living Legend</em> isn&#8217;t likely to win any awards, but hip hop fans will be very happy with it.</p>

<p>The best known Syrian dabke wedding singer, now based in Turkey due to the Syrian civil war, is back with his second studio recording following 147,692 (number approximate) tape releases in his native country.  Souleyman, who uses electronics and his soulful voice to craft fun, incredibly danceable tunes, again worked with Four Tet&#8217;s Kieran Hebden on <em>Bahdeni Nami</em> and the album does not disappoint.  Souleyman&#8217;s lyrics are, of course, in Arabic, so very few native English speakers will be able to understand them, but the sound of his voice blends so well the music&#8217;s high pitched keyboard sounds that their meaning is really irrelevant.  All that matters is the music irresistibly makes hips shake and heads bob.<span id="more-5168"></span></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/the-new-music-friday-3-for-july-24-2015/Mas-Ysa-Seraph.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5169" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/the-new-music-friday-3-for-july-24-2015/Mas-Ysa-Seraph.jpg" alt="Mas Ysa - Seraph" width="280" height="280" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/the-new-music-friday-3-for-july-24-2015/Mas-Ysa-Seraph.jpg 280w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/the-new-music-friday-3-for-july-24-2015/Mas-Ysa-Seraph-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 280px) 100vw, 280px" /></a>Mas Ysa &#8211; <em>Seraph</em></strong></p>
<p>Thomas Arsenault, a/k/a Mas Ysa, is a Canadian electronic musician who uses keyboards and 80&#8217;s drum machine beats to create a stripped back new wave music updated for 2015.  Alternately up tempo and vaguely droning, <em>Seraph</em>, his debut full length, doesn&#8217;t overwhelm the listener with sound, but instead plays with space and mellowness in a manner not common in the genre.  This brings a darkness into the music that separates <em>Seraph</em> from its occasionally punch line inducing forebearers, and creates a fascinating and recommended listen.</p>
<p><a href="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/the-new-music-friday-3-for-july-24-2015/Strange-Wilds-Subjective-Concepts.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5171" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/the-new-music-friday-3-for-july-24-2015/Strange-Wilds-Subjective-Concepts.jpg" alt="Strange Wilds - Subjective Concepts" width="280" height="280" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/the-new-music-friday-3-for-july-24-2015/Strange-Wilds-Subjective-Concepts.jpg 280w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/the-new-music-friday-3-for-july-24-2015/Strange-Wilds-Subjective-Concepts-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 280px) 100vw, 280px" /></a><strong>Strange Wilds &#8211; <em>Subjective Concepts</em></strong></p>
<p>Sub Pop made its name with bands from the Pacific Northwest playing aggressive rock, but over the years they&#8217;ve grown beyond that sound to include everything from Shabazz Palaces&#8217; experimental hip hop to Luluc&#8217;s indie folk.  Strange Wilds is a return to Sub Pop&#8217;s roots.  A power trio from Olympia, Washington, Strange Wilds&#8217; debut LP <em>Subjective Concepts</em> would fit in perfectly with the label&#8217;s 90&#8217;s roster (to the point where the guitar on &#8220;Lost and Found&#8221; sounds lifted directly from &#8220;Smells Like Teen Spirit&#8221;).  Similar in feel to Metz, and made up of roaring guitars and vocals backed by heavy drums and bass, <em>Subjective Concepts</em> is a record made for headbanging and crowdsurfing and is highly recommended for all those lamenting the death of rock.</p>

<p>Prior to his third album as frontman of Tame Impala, Kevin Parker collaborated with Mark Ronson on his mega hit <em>Uptown Special</em> (including singing lead on that album&#8217;s actual best song &#8220;Daffodils&#8221;), and it appears he learned a few things from Ronson.  <em>Currents</em> is still very much a Tame Impala record, but where <em>InnerSpeaker</em> and <em>Lonerism</em> were insular psychedelic rock made for putting on headphones and shutting out the world, <em>Currents</em> takes the band&#8217;s sound in a dancey new direction that begs to be played at high volume at BBQs and on beaches.  Whether it&#8217;s the sprawling jam of &#8220;Let it Happen&#8221;, the earworm hook of &#8220;&#8216;Cause I&#8217;m a Man&#8221;, or the pure beauty of &#8220;Eventually&#8221;, <em>Currents</em> is, quite simply, the perfect summer album.<span id="more-5161"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/the-new-music-friday-3-for-july-17-2015/Future-DS2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5163" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/the-new-music-friday-3-for-july-17-2015/Future-DS2.jpg" alt="Future - DS2" width="280" height="280" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/the-new-music-friday-3-for-july-17-2015/Future-DS2.jpg 280w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/the-new-music-friday-3-for-july-17-2015/Future-DS2-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 280px) 100vw, 280px" /></a><strong>Future &#8211; <em>DS2</em></strong></p>
<p>Future is a busy, busy man.  Following <em>Beast Mode</em> and <em>56 Nights</em>, <em>DS2</em> is already his third full length release of 2015. Happily, the quality of those releases has been uniformly excellent.  <em>DS2</em> is a typical Future release (at least since he stopped trying to be a singer): Nasty, full of bangers, and obsessed with drugs.  In fact, Future makes it clear from <em>DS2</em>&#8216;s very first track &#8220;Thought it was a Drought&#8221;, which includes the line &#8220;I just took a piss and I seen codeine coming out,&#8221; that it&#8217;s a sequel to 2011&#8217;s ode to lean <em>Dirty Sprite</em> in more than just title.  Lean is a recurring presence throughout the album, <a href="https://twitter.com/OGMaco/status/619260164605132800" target="_blank" class="broken_link">much to the likely chagrin of OG Mako</a>, but if that&#8217;s the price of admission to hear Future annihilate some beats, it&#8217;s a steal.</p>
<p><a href="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/the-new-music-friday-3-for-july-17-2015/Bad-Bad-Hats-Psychic-Reader.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5162" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/the-new-music-friday-3-for-july-17-2015/Bad-Bad-Hats-Psychic-Reader.jpg" alt="Bad Bad Hats - Psychic Reader" width="280" height="280" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/the-new-music-friday-3-for-july-17-2015/Bad-Bad-Hats-Psychic-Reader.jpg 280w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/the-new-music-friday-3-for-july-17-2015/Bad-Bad-Hats-Psychic-Reader-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 280px) 100vw, 280px" /></a><strong>Bad Bad Hats &#8211; <em>Psychic Reader</em></strong></p>
<p><em>Psychic Reader</em> is the debut album from Minneapolis indie pop trio Bad Bad Hats.  The band&#8217;s sound, particularly Kerry Alexander&#8217;s melodic voice and sweet lyrics, would fit in well at a label like Slumberland Records (they&#8217;re on the wonderful Afternoon Records, though, who are <a href="http://afternoonrecords.com/bad-bad-hats" target="_blank">giving the album away for free</a>), but there&#8217;s a garage feel to the guitars that gives <em>Psychic Reader</em> a bigger sound.  In fact, the combination of Alexander and that guitar sound strongly resembles Metric more than any other artist.  Regardless of comparisons, though, <em>Psychic Reader</em> is a fun listen that deserves the prerelease press it has received at places like SPIN and NPR.</p>
<p>Also out today: The Chemical Brothers &#8211; <em>Born in the Echoes</em>, Ratatat &#8211; <em>Magnifique</em>, MS MR &#8211; <em>How Does it Feel</em>, and Jason Isbell &#8211; <em>Something More Than Free.</em></p>

<p><em>Summertime &#8217;06</em> starts with intro track &#8220;Ramona Park Legend Pt. 1&#8221;, 35 seconds of idyllic southern California beach sounds mixed with a light beat.  There are waves crashing, a baby cooing, and a lone seagull.  The 36th second is the sound of a gunshot.  From there <em>Summertime &#8217;06</em>, Staples&#8217; debut full length (double album actually), opens up into a 13-year old Staples&#8217; world trying to navigate growing up on the streets in the title season.  Staples has an easy flow, has no trouble sitting in the pocket of a beat, and even when a guest appears he never really turns the album over to anyone else.  This is without a doubt Staples&#8217; memory of coming of age in a gangsta world.  Unlike YG&#8217;s <em>My Krazy Life</em>, which thrived in the gangsta life, or Kendrick Lamar&#8217;s <em>good kid, m.A.A.d. city</em> that chaffed against it, though, <em>Summertime &#8217;06</em> simply tries to survive within its world.  Like those albums, however, <em>Summertime &#8217;06</em> seems destined for the West Coast rap pantheon.<span id="more-5153"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-june-30-2015/Miguel-Wildheart.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5154" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-june-30-2015/Miguel-Wildheart.jpg" alt="Miguel - Wildheart" width="280" height="280" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-june-30-2015/Miguel-Wildheart.jpg 280w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-june-30-2015/Miguel-Wildheart-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 280px) 100vw, 280px" /></a><strong>Miguel &#8211; <em>Wildheart</em></strong></p>
<p>Miguel&#8217;s excellent <em>Kaleidoscope Dream</em> had the unfortunate timing of coming out just a couple months after Frank Ocean&#8217;s world conquering <em>Channel Orange</em>,  but the album was so good it still managed to elbow its way into the R&amp;B conversation.  As of this moment, <em>Wildheart</em> is the entirety of that conversation.  Full of guitars (Lenny Kravitz even makes an appearance, and it works), explicit lyrics, and highlighted by the insanely good &#8220;NWA&#8221;, <em>Wildheart</em> isn&#8217;t about sex.  It simply is sex.  Best of all, though, the album branches beyond the recent wave of PBR&amp;B and is actually more similar in feel (not lyrical content of course) to D&#8217;Angelo &amp; the Vanguard&#8217;s <em>Black Messiah</em>.  This similarity stems from both albums largely shunning obvious hooks and instead relying on an album wide atmosphere to draw in the listener.  In both cases it works to perfection.</p>
<p><a href="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-june-30-2015/Refused-Freedom.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5157" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-june-30-2015/Refused-Freedom.jpg" alt="Refused - Freedom" width="280" height="280" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-june-30-2015/Refused-Freedom.jpg 280w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-june-30-2015/Refused-Freedom-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 280px) 100vw, 280px" /></a><strong>Refused &#8211; <em>Freedom</em></strong></p>
<p>Swedish hardcore band Refused broke up after their instant classic 1998 album <em>The Shape of Punk to Come</em>, but as is the case with all beloved bands other than Led Zeppelin and The Smiths, breakups aren&#8217;t forever.  After playing the festival circuit for a couple years, Refused is fully back with <em>Freedom</em> and they haven&#8217;t missed a beat.  Still influenced in nearly equal measure by punk and metal (although the balance of those influences ebbs and flows from track to track), <em>Freedom</em> is made up of roaring guitars, heavy beats, and political lyrics, and is designed to get listeners hyped.  The only surprise on <em>Freedom</em> is that it fits so well amongst the rest of the band&#8217;s discography after such a long layoff.</p>

<p>Conor Oberst is a busy man.  He has his solo work, he&#8217;s the frontman of Bright Eyes, a member of Monsters of Folk, a founder of Saddle Creek Records, etc. etc. etc.  His hardest hitting job, though, is as the front man of punk band Desaparecidos.  The band was originally formed in 2001 and released <em>Read Music/Speak Spanish</em> the following year before disbanding.  In 2010, the band reformed and started releasing occasional singles, which have been compiled (and added to) on <em>Payola</em>, an album of 14 2-3 minute bursts of pure punk rock.  A listener who goes into <em>Payola</em> expecting the gentle sounds and confessional lyrics of most Oberst projects will be taken aback by the distorted guitars and political ideas, but Oberst isn&#8217;t posing here.  He commits fully to the punk ethos and creates a record with depth, breadth, and a whole lot of fun.<span id="more-5145"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-june-23-2015/Bully-Feels-Like.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5146" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-june-23-2015/Bully-Feels-Like.jpg" alt="Bully - Feels Like" width="280" height="280" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-june-23-2015/Bully-Feels-Like.jpg 280w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-june-23-2015/Bully-Feels-Like-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 280px) 100vw, 280px" /></a><strong>Bully &#8211; <em>Feels Like</em></strong></p>
<p>Bully stems from songs written by frontwoman Alicia Bognanno after an internship at Steve Albini&#8217;s Electrical Audio in Chicago.  Once she returned to Nashville, Bognanno put together a band to bring her songs to life, and the result is a noise pop band heavily influenced by acts of the early 90s.  The songs on Bully&#8217;s debut, <em>Feels Like</em>, are almost uniformly fast paced, feature a loud/quiet/loud formula, and are highlighted by fuzzed out guitars and Bognanno&#8217;s singing alternating between breathy and shouted.  This is an album for speeding down the highway with the windows down and the stereo turned to 11.</p>
<p><a href="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-june-23-2015/Wolf-Alice-My-Love-is-Cool.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5148" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-june-23-2015/Wolf-Alice-My-Love-is-Cool.jpg" alt="Wolf Alice - My Love is Cool" width="280" height="280" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-june-23-2015/Wolf-Alice-My-Love-is-Cool.jpg 280w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-june-23-2015/Wolf-Alice-My-Love-is-Cool-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 280px) 100vw, 280px" /></a><strong>Wolf Alice &#8211; <em>My Love is Cool</em></strong></p>
<p>Following the release of two EPs, London quartet Wolf Alice have spent the last couple years building anticipation for their major label debut.  With the release of <em>My Love is Cool</em>, that debut is finally here, and presents another band heavily influenced by early 90s artists.  Most interestingly, however, the album announces that Wolf Alice is more than a one trick pony.  Lead singles &#8220;Moaning Lisa Smile&#8221; and &#8220;Giant Peach&#8221; ably demonstrated Wolf Alice&#8217;s power and noisier side (very similar to artists like Garbage), but the album actually starts with &#8220;Turn to Dust&#8221; and &#8220;Bros&#8221;, which are almost gentle while maintaining the quality of their predecessors.  <em>My Love is Cool</em> is a well rounded, excellent album.</p>

<p><strong>Fucked Up &#8211; <em>Year of the Hare</em></strong></p>
<p>Toronto hardcore punks Fucked Up have a tradition of an annual EP release based on the Chinese Zodiac.  Interestingly, despite being a hardcore band, each of the Zodiac EPs sees the band try out long, sprawling tracks and <em>Year of the Hare</em> is no exception.  Stretching to a mammoth 21 and a half minutes, the title track opens with nearly 7 minutes of guitar picking/strums and gentle piano before the band and Pink Eyes&#8217; vocals enter in.  Even when they do, it is not a hardcore thrash (although Pink Eyes still sounds as guttural as ever until he drops out in favor of guest vocalist Isla Craig), but a fairly traditional rock song until about the 17 minute mark when the guitars ramp up, cut out completely at about 18:30, roar back with a vengeance, and then end the track the way it began.  It&#8217;s a fascinating listen, as is b-side &#8220;California Cold&#8221;, which features&#8230;flutes?  And drones?  This band is the best.<span id="more-5139"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-june-16-2015/Heartless-Bastards-Restless-Ones.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5141" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-june-16-2015/Heartless-Bastards-Restless-Ones.jpg" alt="Heartless Bastards - Restless Ones" width="280" height="280" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-june-16-2015/Heartless-Bastards-Restless-Ones.jpg 280w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-june-16-2015/Heartless-Bastards-Restless-Ones-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 280px) 100vw, 280px" /></a><strong>Heartless Bastards &#8211; <em>Restless Ones</em></strong></p>
<p>Roots rockers Heartless Bastards&#8217; fifth (!) studio release, <em>Restless Ones</em> continues Erika Wennerstrom&#8217;s exploration of 21st century blues rock.  Anchored by Wennerstrom&#8217;s distinctive, nearly tenor howl, a whole lot of guitar, and highlighted by lead single &#8220;Gates of Dawn&#8221; and &#8220;Into the Light&#8221;, <em>Restless Ones</em>, like basically all Heartless Bastards&#8217; albums before it, is just a solid album from beginning to end.  It&#8217;s really a remarkable thing for a band to continually find tweaks to keep its sound fresh without resorting to a complete reboot, but Heartless Bastards (and Wennerstrom in particular) have managed to find that formula.</p>
<p><a href="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-june-16-2015/Jaakko-Eino-Kalevi-Jaakko-Eino-Kalevi.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5142" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-june-16-2015/Jaakko-Eino-Kalevi-Jaakko-Eino-Kalevi.jpg" alt="Jaakko Eino Kalevi - Jaakko Eino Kalevi" width="280" height="280" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-june-16-2015/Jaakko-Eino-Kalevi-Jaakko-Eino-Kalevi.jpg 280w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-june-16-2015/Jaakko-Eino-Kalevi-Jaakko-Eino-Kalevi-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 280px) 100vw, 280px" /></a><strong>Jaakko Eino Kalevi &#8211; <em>Jaakko Eino Kalevi</em></strong></p>
<p>A Finnish electronic artist, Jaakko Eino Kalevi makes electro pop full of moving color.  His self titled debut (self titled in part because as he told Domino Records &#8220;<span class="ng-isolate-scope">I get my name misspelled so often that I think it’s good to focus on that at this point</span>&#8220;) is a chilled out mix of funk and psychedelic pop that feels like you&#8217;re listening to a vivid dream on a hot summer night.  Album closer &#8220;Ikuinen Purkautumaton Jännite&#8221;, which features horns and what sounds vaguely like a theremin, but is probably synth produced, is particularly trippy and excellent.</p>

<p>Norwegian Jenny Hval makes experimental music made up of gentle, often ethereal, synths and uncompromising lyrics focusing on sex, gender, aging, religion, and other deep personal subjects (the word &#8220;cunt&#8221; is startlingly used on multiple tracks).  This combination of the otherworldly and fully human creates an unsettling, fascinating whole.  <em>Apocalypse, girl</em>, Hval&#8217;s third release under her own name, she previously recorded as Rockettothesky and along with Håvard Volden as Nude on Sand, is her best work to date.  In fact, much of <em>Apocalypse, girl</em> merges all the above topics into one massive exploration of the female condition.  This is not music for idle listening, but requires time and focus.  That time and focus are rewarded, however, with one of the most lyrically interesting albums of the year thus far.<span id="more-5132"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-june-9-2015/No-Joy-More-Faithful.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5135" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-june-9-2015/No-Joy-More-Faithful.jpg" alt="No Joy - More Faithful" width="280" height="280" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-june-9-2015/No-Joy-More-Faithful.jpg 280w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-june-9-2015/No-Joy-More-Faithful-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 280px) 100vw, 280px" /></a><strong>No Joy &#8211; <em>More Faithful</em></strong></p>
<p>Fans of everyone from My Bloody Valentine to Beach House to Vivian Girls will find a lot to love in No Joy&#8217;s shoegazey, noise pop sounds.  Based in Montreal, although band member Jasamine White-Gluz relocated there from LA when the band formed, <em>More Faithful</em> is No Joy&#8217;s third full length, and expands the band&#8217;s sound through increased instrumentation, but otherwise maintains its dreamy feel.  Ordinarily, shoegaze is a genre requiring a dark, brooding atmosphere to fully appreciate the music.  No Joy, however, allow enough light into their guitars and vocals that <em>More Faithful</em> is a perfect accompaniment for a summer&#8217;s evening.</p>
<p><a href="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-june-9-2015/FFS-FFS.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5133" src="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-june-9-2015/FFS-FFS.jpg" alt="FFS - FFS" width="280" height="280" srcset="http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-june-9-2015/FFS-FFS.jpg 280w, http://musicisgood.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/the-new-music-tuesday-3-for-june-9-2015/FFS-FFS-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 280px) 100vw, 280px" /></a><strong>FFS &#8211; <em>FFS</em></strong></p>
<p>A collaboration between Scottish indie rockers Franz Ferdinand and California new wave pop band Sparks is not something the world would ever expect.  Yet &#8220;Piss Off&#8221; dates all the way back to 2004 when Sparks sent the track to Franz Ferdinand and the bands started talking about working together.  Nothing further happened until recently, however, but now FFS is a real band with a self titled album made up of dancey post punk that doesn&#8217;t wow the listener with artistry, but is damn fun.  In fact, when the album is a true collaboration, <em>FFS</em> feels a lot like a Hot Chip album (if Hot Chip replaced most of their synths with guitars and Alexis Taylor sung in a deeper voice, but still).  At times, however, <em>FFS</em> is more Franz Ferdinand than FFS (interestingly one of these times is on &#8220;Collaborations Don&#8217;t Work&#8221;), and those tracks are much less interesting.</p>

<p>In the middle of the organized chaos that is the Soundset festival we had the opportunity to sit down with Twin Cities rapper Manny Phesto.  Born and raised in South Minneapolis, Manny made headlines last fall when &#8220;Manny Phesto for Minnesota&#8221; campaign signs started popping up in yards.  He wasn&#8217;t actually running for any office, but instead used a write-in campaign for all of them as a DIY get-out-the-vote push (according to his website he received votes for Sheriff, Governor, Secretary of State, Attorney General, and several judge positions).  Manny brings the same combination of irreverence in support of serious issues to his music, especially on debut album <em>Southside Looking In </em>released in April of last year.  Our conversation touched on everything from political hip hop and soul samples to what South Minneapolis represents.<span id="more-5115"></span></p>
<p><strong>MiG: You just had your first set at Soundset, right?</strong></p>
<p>MP: Yep.</p>
<p><strong>MiG: How do you think it went?</strong></p>
<p>MP: I feel it went good. It could always go better, but yeah it was good. The energy was good, I didn’t forget any lyrics.</p>
<p><strong>MiG: Good to get it out of the way first thing?</strong></p>
<p>MP: Yeah, at first I didn’t want to play so early. I thought the crowd wouldn’t be as thick, but I feel like the energy was probably higher than it would have been if people had been standing around all day. They were excited just to get going. I feel like it was good.</p>

<p><strong>MiG: You’re from South Minneapolis, and rep it hard. What is it about South Minneapolis that makes you love it so much?</strong></p>
<p>MP: I mean it’s what created me. It’s all I know really. South Minneapolis is the backdrop to everything I write and all the experiences I’ve ever had. It’s where I went to school, where I lost my virginity, where I got drunk the first time. Everything was in South Minneapolis.</p>
<p><strong>MiG: How long has your family been there?</strong></p>
<p>MP: My mother grew up in Minnesota, but not Minneapolis. Probably 30 years.</p>
<p><strong>MiG: And your parents are active in the community in South Minneapolis?</strong></p>
<p>MP: Yeah, they’re active everywhere. My father is a well known <a href="http://www.rlmartstudio.com/" target="_blank">artist and organizer</a>. He’s done a lot for political movements and labor movements and stuff. And my mother has done some organizing work too with a bunch of different movements. With the farm workers back in the day and a lot of stuff. Yeah, I’ve lived in a very political/politically active family.</p>
<p><strong>MiG: And you bring that into your music as well.</strong></p>
<p>MP: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>MiG: What is it do you think about hip hop that speaks to you to bring that part of your background into it?</strong></p>
<p>MP: I feel like that’s the essence of hip hop. Hip hop was born in the ghettos, you know, in the struggle and that’s all that politics is. These are the issues that affect us on the day-to-day, and in hip hop it’s all about people relating to you, and a lot of times people don’t even think of certain issues in certain ways. And if you can write it in a way that they’ll relate to it, then you’ll get them to think about something a little more important than they might normally think about.</p>
<p><strong>MiG: It seems to me there hasn’t been as much politically conscious hip hop, being popular at least, right now.</strong></p>
<p>MP: There’s a thin line between politically conscious and shoving your politics down someone’s throat, and I feel like a lot of people that are political rappers don’t know where that line is and there just spitting facts at people. Like “the U.S. did this in ’65 and this” and that’s not how it’s gotta be. It’s got to be real situations that people can relate to.</p>
<p><strong>MiG: What kind of situations are we talking?</strong></p>
<p>MP: I mean, being evicted from your house for one…having your ass beat by the police…anything that I would write about that people might not think about in the way that I frame it.</p>
<p><strong>MiG: But you aren’t all political. You’ve got your fun side as well.</strong></p>
<p>MP: Yeah, I mean, nobody’s all anything, right? We’re all…life’s all about dualities. So, I’m a normal 20-something. I like to kick it, have fun, and go out, but at the same time I’m thinking about shit.</p>
<p><strong>MiG: You’ve described your style as ‘stream-of-consciousness’. What does that mean to you?</strong></p>
<p>MP: For a while I had trouble writing about one specific topic for a whole song, and one of my friends told me ‘man, don’t even worry about it. Your music is just stream-of-consciousness. Whatever comes up in your mind is what you’re speaking on and it all ties in together somehow.’ So that’s really what I think. A song could just be a day in my life. I could go from going to the store, to watching the news, to going to a show, to watching a crackhead overdoes, or whatever. It’s just…stream-of-consciousness.</p>

<p>MP: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>MiG: What is it about the soul style that speaks to you?</strong></p>
<p>MP: I don’t know, man. It’s the same feeling I get when I hear really dope scratches or a really nasty beat. It just gives you the ‘I smell poop face,’ and you just scrunch up like, ‘ugh, that is so nasty!’ A dope soul sample does that to me. It’s probably just the era of hip hop I was listening to when I came up was a lot of east coast sample based artists, so I guess that’s what resonates with me.</p>
<p><strong>MiG: Do you listen to much of the old soul?</strong></p>
<p>MP: I don’t listen to a lot of old soul. I listen to a lot of reggae actually. When I started writing I started writing to reggae music because I didn’t have any rap beats. The internet was pretty new at that point.</p>

Did I see correctly, your dad actually did the artwork?</strong></p>
<p>MP: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>MiG: That must have been pretty cool.</strong></p>
<p>MP: It was awesome. Got to keep it in the family.</p>
<p><strong>MiG: What does that album say about you?</strong></p>
<p>MP: It says the type of things I was thinking about at that time. That album…I wrote it about a year and a half ago now and it came out about a year ago. So it’s just the things of a 23-year-old going through life. My hopes, aspirations, plans, and struggles.</p>
<p><strong>MiG: Things are going well with it. You got some good press.</strong></p>
<p>MP: Things honestly couldn’t be going better with it. What I’ve been able to do, or what my album has been able to do for me I should say, is mind blowing. It’s awesome.</p>
<p><strong>MiG: One of those things, is you got to sit down with Sway the other day. How was that for you?</strong></p>
<p>MP: It was awesome. I grew up seeing Sway. It was definitely a bucket list item. Just like this [playing Soundset]. This year is full of bucket list items.</p>
<p><strong>MiG: You seem to be hustling as best you can, here at Soundset. Setting up interviews, doing what you can.</strong></p>
<p>MP: Yeah, I wasn’t even expecting them to send me the press list, so I got it and am like ‘man, I gotta take advantage of this.’</p>
<p><strong>MiG: Does that come a little bit from that political organizing background? You gotta work the system?</strong></p>
<p>MP: It could! That’s everything, though. If you don’t make things happen, they’re not going to happen. Growing up in the Minneapolis, or not even growing up in it, but witnessing the hip hop scene here, there’s a lot of people that don’t necessarily promote their music as much as they should. There are a lot of albums that are awesome that just kind of fly-by-night because they don’t have the promotion behind them that they need. So I just…going in, I knew that I needed to get everything that I could out of this project. It takes a lot of effort to write an album, record an album, print it up, and put it out, and it sucks to see somebody, not wasting, but not getting what they can out of that effort.</p>
<p><strong>MiG: Overall how do you think the local scene is?</strong></p>
<p>MP: It’s fucking awesome. I’ve been a few different places and I’ve heard from a lot of locals that there’s no scene like this one. It’s the comradery. Like I could go to a show by myself any night of the week and see ten artists that I know and get a ride home from one of them. It’s a big family and people support each other. When I was performing there were five other artists that are going to be performing sidestage watching me. They’re not just kicking it and smoking in the green room.</p>
<p><strong>MiG: What do you think it is about Minneapolis/St. Paul that nurtures that?</strong></p>
<p>MP: I think it’s a small/big city. Once you know everybody, you either like them or you don’t and most people seem to like each other.</p>

<p>MP: Yeah! In two weeks <a href="http://mannyphesto.com/portfolio/intra-island-music-tour/" target="_blank">I get to play four islands</a>. But that still hasn’t quite hit me yet. That’s going to happen after today.</p>
<p><strong>MiG: And then when you come back, you’ve got another big show over in Somerset.</strong></p>
<p>MP: Yeah, actually right when I get back, two days later I’m going to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/HipHopFestSJ1" target="_blank">Duluth for a festival</a> and then 4th of July I’m doing Sioux City Iowa, and Aretha Franklin is playing that. <a href="http://saturdayinthepark.com/" target="_blank">Saturday in the Park </a>it’s called, and then I’m touring throughout August, late July and early August, and then I’m doing <a href="http://mannyphesto.com/portfolio/summerset-music-festival-2015/" target="_blank">Somerset in mid-August</a>. Then I’m booking a tour for Colorado in September and doing at least one date in Havana [Cuba] in October.  One of my goals coming into the year was to plan out as much as I could in advance. So I’ve been sending emails to festivals and venues and everybody just trying to fill my calendar up</p>
<p><strong>MiG: Working on writing any new stuff yet?</strong></p>
<p>MP: Yeah, actually just the last month or so I’ve been getting the energy back to write. It was kind of a dead zone in the winter for me, but it’s been good. I’ve written a few more songs and done some collaborations.</p>
<p><strong>MiG: Who have you been working with?</strong></p>
<p>MP: I just did a song with <a href="https://richgarvey.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank">Rich Garvey</a>. Just did a song with this kid <a href="http://micqa.com/" target="_blank">Mic Q.A.</a> from this crew Mill City Collective that’s coming up right now. Just did a song with this kid <a href="http://kentageous.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Ken-C</a> from a crew called Skoolboy in St. Paul. <a href="https://marbury.bandcamp.com/releases" target="_blank">Mike the Martyr</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/AxelFoleyMN/info?tab=page_info" target="_blank">Axel Foley</a>, my normal partners in crime. <a href="http://www.rhymesayers.com/iselfdevine" target="_blank">I Self Devine</a>, one of the Rhymesayers OGs who was in the Micronaughts, we just wrote something. Just trying to write a lot and then see where it all fits together as far as projects.</p>
<p><strong>MiG: Sounds like things are popping.</strong></p>
<p>MP: Yeah, I feel blessed.</p>
